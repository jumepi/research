"Higgs signals and hard photons via $WW$-fusion in the Standard Model at
  the Next Linear Collider","Within the framework of the Standard Model, integrated and differential
distributions are given for Higgs production via the $WW$-fusion mechanism and
decay via the channels $H\ar b\bar b$ and $H\ar WW\ar {jjjj}$, with and without
photon radiation, at Next Linear Collider energies. Calculations are carried
out at tree-level and rates of the leading processes $e^+e^-\ar\bar\nu_e\nu_e H
\ar \bar\nu_e\nu_e b\bar b $ and $e^+e^-\ar\bar\nu_e\nu_e H \ar \bar\nu_e\nu_e
WW \ar \bar\nu_e\nu_e {jjjj}$ are compared to those of the next-to-leading
reactions $e^+e^-\ar\bar\nu_e\nu_e H (\gamma)\ar \bar\nu_e\nu_e b\bar b \gamma$
and $e^+e^-\ar\bar\nu_e\nu_e H (\gamma)\ar \bar\nu_e\nu_e WW (\gamma) \ar
\bar\nu_e\nu_e {jjjj}\gamma$, in the case of hard and detectable photons.
Finally, a brief discussion concerning the case of $H\ar ZZ\ar{jjjj} (\gamma)$
decays is also given.",['Stefano Moretti'],1996-06-07T16:24:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9606268v1
Construction of zero autocorrelation stochastic waveforms,"Stochastic waveforms are constructed whose expected autocorrelation can be
made arbitrarily small outside the origin. These waveforms are unimodular and
complex-valued. Waveforms with such spike like autocorrelation are desirable in
waveform design and are particularly useful in areas of radar and
communications. Both discrete and continuous waveforms with low expected
autocorrelation are constructed. Further, in the discrete case, frames for the
d-dimensional complex space are constructed from these waveforms and the frame
properties of such frames are studied.",['Somantika Datta'],2012-07-20T20:28:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5055v1
Rings Whose Clean Elements Are Uniquely Strongly Clean,"We define the class of {\it CUSC} rings, that are those rings whose clean
elements are uniquely strongly clean. These rings are a common generalization
of the so-called {\it USC} rings, introduced by Chen-Wang-Zhou in J. Pure \&
Applied Algebra (2009), which are rings whose elements are uniquely strongly
clean. These rings also generalize the so-called {\it CUC} rings, defined by
Calugareanu-Zhou in Mediterranean J. Math. (2023), which are rings whose clean
elements are uniquely clean. We establish that a ring is USC if, and only if,
it is simultaneously CUSC and potent. Some other interesting relationships with
CUC rings are obtained as well.","['Peter Danchev', 'Omid Hasanzadeh', 'Ahmad Moussavi']",2024-01-07T10:55:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03449v1

On structure of topological metagroups,"In this article topologies on metagroups are studied. They are related with
generalized $C^*$-algebras over ${\bf R}$ or ${\bf C}$. Homomorphisms and
quotient maps on them are investigated. Structure of topological metagroups is
scrutinized. In particular, topologies on smashed products and smashed twisted
wreath products of metagroups are scrutinized, which are making them
topological metagroups. Moreover, their inverse homomorphism systems are
studied.",['Sergey Victor Ludkowski'],2021-10-28T17:23:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15308v1
Evolution of active region outflows throughout an active region lifetime,"We have shown previously that SOHO/UVCS data allow us to detect active region
(AR) outflows at coronal altitudes higher than those reached by other
instrumentation. These outflows are thought to be a component of the slow solar
wind. Our purpose is to study the evolution of the outflows in the intermediate
corona from AR 8100, from the time the AR first forms until it dissolves, after
several transits at the solar limb. Data acquired by SOHO/UVCS at the time of
the AR limb transits, at medium latitudes and at altitudes ranging from 1.5 to
2.3 R_sun, were used to infer the physical properties of the outflows through
the AR evolution. To this end, we applied the Doppler dimming technique to UVCS
spectra. These spectra include the H I Lyman alpha line and the O VI doublet
lines at 1031.9 and 1037.6 A. Plasma speeds and electron densities of the
outflows were inferred over several rotations of the Sun. AR outflows are
present in the newly born AR and persist throughout the entire AR life.
Moreover, we found two types of outflows at different latitudes, both possibly
originating in the same negative polarity area of the AR. We also analyzed the
behavior of the Si XII 520 A line along the UVCS slit in an attempt to reveal
changes in the Si abundance when different regions are traversed. Although we
found some evidence for a Si enrichment in the AR outflows, alternative
interpretations are also plausible. Our results demonstrate that outflows from
ARs are detectable in the intermediate corona throughout the whole AR lifetime.
This confirms that outflows contribute to the slow wind.","['L. Zangrilli', 'G. Poletto']",2016-08-26T09:48:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07408v1
Cluster Based Cost Efficient Intrusion Detection System For Manet,"Mobile ad-hoc networks are temporary wireless networks. Network resources are
abnormally consumed by intruders. Anomaly and signature based techniques are
used for intrusion detection. Classification techniques are used in anomaly
based techniques. Intrusion detection techniques are used for the network
attack detection process. Two types of intrusion detection systems are
available. They are anomaly detection and signature based detection model. The
anomaly detection model uses the historical transactions with attack labels.
The signature database is used in the signature based IDS schemes.
  The mobile ad-hoc networks are infrastructure less environment. The intrusion
detection applications are placed in a set of nodes under the mobile ad-hoc
network environment. The nodes are grouped into clusters. The leader nodes are
assigned for the clusters. The leader node is assigned for the intrusion
detection process. Leader nodes are used to initiate the intrusion detection
process. Resource sharing and lifetime management factors are considered in the
leader election process. The system optimizes the leader election and intrusion
detection process.
  The system is designed to handle leader election and intrusion detection
process. The clustering scheme is optimized with coverage and traffic level.
Cost and resource utilization is controlled under the clusters. Node mobility
is managed by the system.","['Saravanan Kumarasamy', 'Hemalatha B', 'Hashini P']",2013-11-06T16:59:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.1446v1
"Inelastic processes in Na$^{+}-$Ne, Ar and Ne$^{+},$ Ar$^{+}-$Na
  collisions in energy range $0.5-14$ keV","Absolute cross sections for charge-exchange, ionization and excitation in
Na$% ^{+}-$Ne and Na$^{+}-$Ar collisions were measured in the ion energy range
$% 0.5-10$ keV using a refined version of a capacitor method, and collision and
optical spectroscopy methods simultaneously in the same experimental set-up.
Ionization cross sections for Ne$^{+}-$Na and Ar$^{+}-$Na collisions are
measured at the energies of $2-14$ keV using a crossed-beam spectroscopy
method. The experimental data and the schematic correlation diagrams are used
to analyze and determine the mechanisms for these processes. For the
charge-exchange process in Na$^{+}$ $-$Ar collisions two nonadiabatic regions
are revealed and mechanisms responsible for these regions are explained.
Structural peculiarity on the excitation function for the resonance lines of
argon atoms in Na$^{+}$ $-$Ar collisions are observed and the possible
mechanisms of this phenomenon are explored. The measured ionization cross
sections for Na$^{+}-$Ne and Ne$^{+}-$Na collisions in conjunction with the
Landau-Zener formula are used to determine the coupling matrix element and
transition probability in a region of pseudo-crossing of the potential curves.","['R. A. Lomsadze', 'M. R. Gochitashvili', 'R. Ya. Kezerashvili']",2015-10-06T03:14:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01418v1
Evaluation of Social Biases in Recent Large Pre-Trained Models,"Large pre-trained language models are widely used in the community. These
models are usually trained on unmoderated and unfiltered data from open sources
like the Internet. Due to this, biases that we see in platforms online which
are a reflection of those in society are in turn captured and learned by these
models. These models are deployed in applications that affect millions of
people and their inherent biases are harmful to the targeted social groups. In
this work, we study the general trend in bias reduction as newer pre-trained
models are released. Three recent models ( ELECTRA, DeBERTa, and DistilBERT)
are chosen and evaluated against two bias benchmarks, StereoSet and
CrowS-Pairs. They are compared to the baseline of BERT using the associated
metrics. We explore whether as advancements are made and newer, faster, lighter
models are released: are they being developed responsibly such that their
inherent social biases have been reduced compared to their older counterparts?
The results are compiled and we find that all the models under study do exhibit
biases but have generally improved as compared to BERT.","['Swapnil Sharma', 'Nikita Anand', 'Kranthi Kiran G. V.', 'Alind Jain']",2023-04-13T23:29:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06861v1
"Statistical Study of Coronal Mass Ejection Source Locations: II. Role of
  Active Regions in CME Production","This is the second paper of the statistical study of coronal mass ejection
(CME) source locations, in which the relationship between CMEs and active
regions (ARs) is statistically studied on the basis of the information of CME
source locations and the ARs automatically extracted from magnetic synoptic
charts of Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) during 1997 -- 1998. It is found that
about 63% of the CMEs are related with ARs, at least about 53% of the ARs
produced one or more CMEs, and particularly about 14% of ARs are CME-rich (3 or
more CMEs were generated) during one transit across the visible disk. Several
issues are then tried to clarify: whether or not the CMEs originating from ARs
are distinct from others, whether or not the CME kinematics depend on AR
properties, and whether or not the CME productivity depends on AR properties.
The statistical results suggest that (1) there is no evident difference between
AR-related and non-AR-related CMEs in terms of CME speed, acceleration and
width, (2) the size, strength and complexity of ARs do little with the
kinematic properties of CMEs, but have significant effects on the CME
productivity, and (3) the sunspots in all the most productive ARs at least
belong to $\beta\gamma$ type, whereas 90% of those in CME-less ARs are $\alpha$
or $\beta$ type only. A detailed analysis on CME-rich ARs further reveals that
(1) the distribution of the waiting time of same-AR CMEs, consists of two parts
with a separation at about 15 hours, which implies that the CMEs with a waiting
time shorter than 15 hours are probably truly physical related, and (2) an AR
tends to produce such related same-AR CMEs at a pace of 8 hours, but cannot
produce two or more fast CMEs (>800 km/s) within a time interval of 15 hours.
This interesting phenomenon is particularly discussed.","['Caixia Chen', 'Yuming Wang', 'Chenglong Shen', 'Pinzhong Ye', 'Jie Zhang', 'S. Wang']",2011-10-09T03:30:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.1787v1
"Temporal and Periodic Variations of Sunspot Counts in Flaring and
  Non-flaring Active Regions","We analyzed temporal and periodic behavior of sunspot counts (SSCs) in
flaring (C, M, or X class flares), and non-flaring active regions (ARs) for the
almost two solar cycles (1996 through 2016). Our main findings are as follows:
i) The temporal variation of monthly means of daily total SSCs in flaring and
non-flaring ARs are different and these differences are also varying from cycle
to cycle; temporal profile of non-flaring ARs are wider than the flaring ones
during the solar cycle 23, while they are almost the same during the current
cycle 24. The second peak (second maximum) of flaring ARs are strongly dominate
during current cycle 24, while this difference is not such a remarkable during
cycle 23. The amplitude of SSCs in the non-flaring ARs are comparable during
the first and second peaks (maxima) of the current solar cycle, while the first
peak is almost not existent in case of the flaring ARs. ii) Periodic variations
observed in SSCs of flaring and non-flaring ARs are quite different in both MTM
spectrum and wavelet scalograms and these variations are also different from
one cycle to another; the largest detected period in the flaring ARs is 113
days, while there are much higher periodicities (327, 312, and 256 days) in
non-flaring ARs. There are no meaningful periodicities in MTM spectrum of
flaring ARs exceeding 45 days during solar cycle 24, while a 113 days
periodicity detected from flaring ARs of solar cycle 23. For the non-flaring
ARs the largest period is 72 days during solar cycle 24, while the largest
period is 327 days during current cycle.","['A. Kilcik', 'V. Yurchyshyn', 'B. Donmez', 'V. N. Obridko', 'A. Ozguc', 'J. P. Rozelot']",2017-05-25T06:51:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09065v1

16 functions, which with specific selection of coordinates reduce to 12. Since
there are 10 field equations, two functions in the solution are completely

those surfaces are lines, and so the surfaces are ruled. And it finishes
comparing the classification of minimal ruled surfaces to that of maximal ruled
surfaces.

is put in the Weyl semimetal band tilting direction, which is similar to the
double reflections of light in anisotropic crystals. The directions of the
double (retro and specular) ARs are symmetric about the normal due to the
hyperboloidal Fermi surface near the Weyl nodes, but with different AR
amplitudes depending on the direction and energy of the incident electron. When
the normal direction of the Weyl semimetal-superconductor interface is changed
from parallel to perpendicular with the tilt direction, the double ARs
gradually evolve from one retro-AR and one specular AR, passing through double

we aimed to examine the usability of current mobile AR applications and
interpreting classic usability heuristics in the context of mobile AR.
Particularly, we focused on AR home design apps because of their popularity and
ability to incorporate important mobile AR interaction schemas. Our findings
indicated that it is important for the designers to consider the unfamiliarity
of AR technology to the vast users and to take technological limitations into
consideration when designing mobile AR apps. Our work serves as a first step

Model-based bias correction for short AR(1) and AR(2) processes,"The class of autoregressive (AR) processes is extensively used to model
temporal dependence in observed time series. Such models are easily available
and routinely fitted using freely available statistical software like R. A
potential caveat in analyzing short time series is that commonly applied
estimators for the coefficients of AR processes are severely biased. This paper
suggests a model-based approach for bias correction of well-known estimators
for the coefficients of first and second-order stationary AR processes, taking
the sampling distribution of the original estimator into account. This is
achieved by modeling the relationship between the true and estimated AR
coefficients using weighted orthogonal polynomial regression, fitted to a huge
number of simulations. The finite-sample distributions of the new estimators
are approximated using transformations of skew-normal densities and their
properties are demonstrated by simulations and in the analysis of a real
ecological data set. The new estimators are easily available in our
accompanying R-package ARbiascorrect for time series of length n = 10, 11, ...

Why is a flare-rich active region CME-poor?,"Solar active regions (ARs) are the major sources of two kinds of the most
violent solar eruptions, namely flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The
largest AR in the past 24 years, NOAA AR 12192, crossed the visible disk from
2014 October 17 to 30, unusually produced more than one hundred flares,
including 32 M-class and 6 X-class ones, but only one small CME. Flares and
CMEs are believed to be two phenomena in the same eruptive process. Why is such
a flare-rich AR so CME-poor? We compared this AR with other four ARs; two were
productive in both and two were inert. The investigation of the photospheric
parameters based on the SDO/HMI vector magnetogram reveals that the flare-rich
AR 12192, as the other two productive ARs, has larger magnetic flux, current
and free magnetic energy than the two inert ARs, but contrast to the two
productive ARs, it has no strong, concentrated current helicity along both
sides of the flaring neutral line, indicating the absence of a mature magnetic
structure consisting of highly sheared or twisted field lines. Furthermore, the
decay index above the AR 12192 is relatively low, showing strong constraint.
These results suggest that productive ARs are always large and have enough
current and free energy to power flares, but whether or not a flare is
accompanied by a CME is seemingly related to (1) if there is mature sheared or
twisted core field serving as the seed of the CME, (2) if the constraint of the
overlying arcades is weak enough.","['Lijuan Liu', 'Yuming Wang', 'Jingxiu Wang', 'Chenglong Shen', 'Pinzhong Ye', 'Rui Liu', 'Jun Chen', 'Quanhao Zhang', 'S. Wang']",2016-07-26T03:48:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07531v1
"Electric Current Neutralization in Solar Active Regions and Its Relation
  to Eruptive Activity","It is well established that magnetic free energy associated with electric
currents powers solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from solar
active regions (ARs). However, the conditions that determine whether an AR will
produce an eruption are not well understood. Previous work suggests that the
degree to which the driving electric currents, or the sum of all currents
within a single magnetic polarity, are neutralized may serve as a good proxy
for assessing the ability of ARs to produce eruptions. Here, we investigate the
relationship between current neutralization and flare/CME production using a
sample of 15 flare-active and 15 flare-quiet ARs. All flare-quiet and 4
flare-active ARs are also CME-quiet. We additionally test the relation of
current neutralization to the degree of shear along polarity inversion lines
(PILs) in an AR. We find that flare-productive ARs are more likely to exhibit
non-neutralized currents, specifically those that also produce a CME. We find
that flare/CME-active ARs also exhibit higher degrees of PIL shear than
flare/CME-quiet ARs. We additionally observe that currents become more
neutralized during magnetic flux emergence in flare-quiet ARs. Our
investigation suggests that current neutralization in ARs is indicative of
their eruptive potential.","['Ellis A. Avallone', 'Xudong Sun']",2020-03-05T18:32:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02814v1

"Activity Related Variations of High-Degree p-Mode Amplitude, Width and
  Energy in Solar Active Regions","We study the properties of high degree p-mode oscillations in flaring and
dormant ARs and compare them with those in corresponding quiet regions (QRs) to
find the association of mode parameters with magnetic and flare related
activities. Our analysis of several flaring and dormant ARs, showed strong
association of mode amplitude, width and energy with magnetic and flare
activities although their changes are combined effects of foreshortening,
filling factor, magnetic activity, flare activity, and measurement
uncertainties. We find that the largest decrease in mode amplitude and
background power of an AR are caused by the angular distance of the AR from the
solar disc centre. After correcting the mode parameters for foreshortening and
filling factor, we find that the mode amplitude of flaring and dormant ARs are
smaller than in corresponding QRs, and decreases with increasing MAI suggesting
a larger mode power suppression in ARs with stronger magnetic fields. The mode
widths in ARs are larger than in corresponding QRs and increase with MAI,
indicating shorter lifetimes of modes in ARs than in QRs. The largest decrease
(increase) in mode amplitude (mode width) of dormant ARs is found in the five
minute frequency band. The average mode energy of both the flaring and dormant
ARs are smaller than in their corresponding QRs, decreasing with increasing
MAI. But the average mode energy decrease rate in flaring ARs are smaller than
in dormant ARs. Also, the increase in mode width rate in dormant (flaring) ARs
is followed by decrease (increase) in amplitude variation rate. Furthermore,
inclusion of mode corrections for MAI shows that mode amplitude and mode energy
of flaring ARs increase with FI while mode width shows an opposite trend. The
increase (decrease) in mode amplitude (width) is larger in the five minute and
higher frequency band. Increase in width variation rate is ...","['R. A. Maurya', 'A. Ambastha', 'J. Chae']",2013-10-24T01:57:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6458v1

"Shift equivalence and a category equivalence involving graded modules

quotient of the category of graded vector space representations of the quiver
obtained by making the graded representations that are the sum of their finite
dimensional submodules isomorphic to zero.
  Actually, the main result in this paper is that the abelian categories are
equivalent if the incidence matrices are strong shift equivalent. That result
is combined with an earlier result of the author to prove that if the incidence
matrices are shift equivalent, then the associated abelian categories are
equivalent.
  Given William's Theorem that subshifts of finite type associated to two

equivalent, our main result can be reformulated as follows: if the subshifts

Fractional Calculus - A Commutative Method on Real Analytic Functions,"The traditional first approach to fractional calculus is via the

$g': K \to C^{\omega}(\mathbb{R}$), and operator $D^{k}: K \to K$ such that the
operator $D^{k}$ commutes with itself, the map $g$ embeds

Concise formulae and algorithms are devised for these graph invariants and
several important properties of these graphs are formally proven. Integer
sequences of these invariants in natural order by $n$ are computed and several
new sequences are identified by comparing them to existing sequences in the
On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences. These new and existing integer
sequences are interpreted from the graph theory point of view. Both $G^H(n)$

An adaptive Ridge procedure for L0 regularization,"Penalized selection criteria like AIC or BIC are among the most popular
methods for variable selection. Their theoretical properties have been studied
intensively and are well understood, but making use of them in case of
high-dimensional data is difficult due to the non-convex optimization problem
induced by L0 penalties. An elegant solution to this problem is provided by the
multi-step adaptive lasso, where iteratively weighted lasso problems are
solved, whose weights are updated in such a way that the procedure converges
towards selection with L0 penalties. In this paper we introduce an adaptive
ridge procedure (AR) which mimics the adaptive lasso, but is based on weighted
Ridge problems. After introducing AR its theoretical properties are studied in
the particular case of orthogonal linear regression. For the non-orthogonal
case extensive simulations are performed to assess the performance of AR. In
case of Poisson regression and logistic regression it is illustrated how the
iterative procedure of AR can be combined with iterative maximization
procedures. The paper ends with an efficient implementation of AR in the

the AR. This is shown by logarithmic plots of CME speed (from the SOHO LASCO
CME catalog) versus each of ten AR-integrated magnetic parameters (AR magnetic
flux, three different AR magnetic-twist parameters, and six AR
free-magnetic-energy proxies) measured from the vertical and horizontal field
components of vector magnetograms (from the {\it Solar Dynamics Observatory's
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager}) of the source ARs of 189 CMEs. These plots
show: (1) the speed of the fastest CMEs that an AR can produce increases with
each of these whole-AR magnetic parameters, and (2) that one of the AR
magnetic-twist parameters and the corresponding free-magnetic-energy proxy each
determine the CME-speed upper-limit line somewhat better than any of the other
eight whole-AR magnetic parameters.","['Sanjiv K. Tiwari', 'David A. Falconer', 'Ronald L. Moore', 'P. Venkatakrishnan', 'Amy R. Winebarger', 'Igor G. Khazanov']",2015-08-06T20:19:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01532v1
"Lepton scattering from $^{40}$Ar and $^{48}$Ti in the quasielastic peak
  region","Neutron and proton spectral functions of $^{40}$Ar, $^{40}$Ca, and $^{48}$Ti
isotopes are computed using the ab initio self-consistent Green's function
approach. The resulting radii and charge distributions are in good agreement
with available experimental data. The spectral functions of Ar and Ti are then
utilized to calculate inclusive ($e$,$e$') cross sections within a
factorization scheme and are found to correctly reproduce the recent Jefferson
Lab measurements. Based on these successful agreements, the weak charged and
neutral current double-differential cross sections for neutrino-$^{40}$Ar
scattering are predicted in the quasielastic region. Results obtained by
replacing the (experimentally inaccessible) neutron spectral distribution of
$^{40}$Ar with the (experimentally accessible) proton distribution of $^{48}$Ti
are compared and the accuracy of this approximation is assessed.","['C. Barbieri', 'N. Rocco', 'V. Somà']",2019-07-02T01:43:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01122v2
"Construction of Convex Sets on Quadrilateral Ordered Tiles or Graphs
  with Propagation Neighborhood Operations. Dales, Concavity Structures.
  Application to Gray Image Analysis of Human-Readable Shapes","An effort has been made to show mathematicians some new ideas applied to
image analysis. Gray images are presented as tilings. Based on topological
properties of the tiling, a number of gray convex hulls: maximal, minimal, and
oriented ones are constructed and some are proved. They are constructed with
only one operation. Two tilings are used in the Constraint and Allowance types
of operations. New type of concavity described: a dale. All operations are
parallel, possible to realize clock-less. Convexities define what is the
background. They are treated as separate gray objects. There are multiple
relations among them and their descendants. Via that, topological size of
concavities is proposed. Constructed with the same type of operations, Rays and
Angles in a tiling define possible spatial relations. Notions like ""strokes""
are defined through concavities. Unusual effects on levelized gray objects are
shown. It is illustrated how alphabet and complex hieroglyphs can be described
through concavities and their relations. A hypothesis of living organisms image
analysis is proposed. A number of examples with symbols and a human face are
calculated with new Asynchwave C++ software library.",['Igor Polkovnikov'],2016-08-29T21:12:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08251v1
Soliton-Generating $τ$-Functions Revisited,"Within the framework of the Inverse-Scattering formalism and the Hirota
algorithm, soliton solutions of evolution equations are images of
{\tau}-functions. Typically, the latter are expressed in terms of exponentials,
the arguments of which are linear in the coordinates. Consequently, often,
{\tau}-functions are unbounded in space and time. However, they are not unique.
Exploitation of their non-uniqueness uncovers physically interesting
possibilities: 1) One can construct equivalent {\tau}-functions, which generate
the same traditional (Inverse-Scattering/Hirota)) soliton solutions, yet allow
for the extension of the family of soliton solutions to a wider, parametric
family, in which the traditional solutions are a subset. The parameters are
shifts in individual soliton trajectories. 2) When two wave numbers in a
multi-soliton solution are made to coincide, the reduction of the solution to
one with a lower number of solitons is qualitatively different for solutions
that are within the traditional subset and those that are outside this subset.
3) One can construct {\tau}-functions that are bounded in space and time, in
terms of which soliton solutions become images of localized sources.",['Yair Zarmi'],2018-04-02T18:21:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00683v1
Gluck twists on concordant or homotopic spheres,"Let $M$ be a compact $4$-manifold and let $S$ and $T$ be embedded $2$-spheres

$4$-manifolds obtained by the Gluck twist operation on $M$ along $S$ and $T$
respectively. We show that if $S$ and $T$ are concordant, then $M_S$ and $M_T$
are $s$-cobordant, and so if $\pi_1(M)$ is good, then $M_S$ and $M_T$ are
homeomorphic. Similarly, if $S$ and $T$ are homotopic then we show that $M_S$
and $M_T$ are simple homotopy equivalent. Under some further assumptions, we
deduce that $M_S$ and $M_T$ are homeomorphic. We show that additional
assumptions are necessary by giving an example where $S$ and $T$ are homotopic
but $M_S$ and $M_T$ are not homeomorphic. We also give an example where $S$ and

Are Cluster Dwarfs Recycled Galaxies?,"Although cluster dwarf galaxies are often neglected due to their faintness,
recent observations demonstrate that they are critical for understanding the
physical processes behind galaxy and cluster formation. Dwarfs are the most
common galaxy type and are particularly abundant in clusters. Recent
observational results suggest that dwarfs in dense environments do not all form
early in the universe, as expected from hierarchical structure formation
models. Many of these systems appear to be younger and more metal rich than
dwarfs in lower density areas, suggesting they are possibly created by a tidal
process. Several general galaxy cluster observations, including steep
luminosity functions and the origin of intracluster light, are natural outcomes
of these processes.",['Christopher J. Conselice'],2003-12-12T23:01:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0312351v1

Joint and double coboundaries of commuting contractions,"Let $T$ and $S$ be commuting contractions on a Banach space $X$. The elements

unitary operators induced on $L_2$ by commuting invertible measure preserving
transformations which generate an aperiodic $\mathbb Z^2$-action, we show that
there are joint coboundaries in $L_2$ which are not double coboundaries. We
prove that if $\alpha$,$\beta \in (0,1)$ are irrational, with $T_\alpha$ and
$T_\beta$ induced on $L_1(\mathbb T)$ by the corresponding rotations, then
there are joint coboundaries in $C(\mathbb T)$ which are not measurable double

"Parabolic and elliptic equations with singular or degenerate
  coefficients: the Dirichlet problem","We consider the Dirichlet problem for a class of elliptic and parabolic
equations in the upper-half space $\mathbb{R}^d_+$, where the coefficients are
the product of $x_d^\alpha, \alpha \in (-\infty, 1),$ and a bounded uniformly
elliptic matrix of coefficients. Thus, the coefficients are singular or
degenerate near the boundary $\{x_d =0\}$ and they may not locally integrable.
The novelty of the work is that we find proper weights under which the
existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions in Sobolev spaces are
established. These results appear to be the first of their kind and are new
even if the coefficients are constant. They are also readily extended to
systems of equations.","['Hongjie Dong', 'Tuoc Phan']",2020-09-16T22:47:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07967v1

Error Correcting Codes on Algebraic Surfaces,"Error correcting codes are defined and important parameters for a code are

studied. In particular, codes resulting from blowing up points in $\proj^2$ are

resulting from ruled surfaces over curves of genus 0 are completely analyzed,
and some codes are discovered that are better than direct product Reed Solomon
codes of similar length. Ruled surfaces over genus 1 curves are also studied,
but not all classes are completely analyzed. However, in this case a family of
codes are found that are comparable in performance to the direct product code
of a Reed Solomon code and a Goppa code. Some further work is done on surfaces
from higher genus curves, but there remains much work to be done in this
direction to understand fully the resulting codes. Codes resulting from blowing
points on surfaces are also studied, obtaining necessary parameters for
constructing infinite families of such codes.

"Retargetable AR: Context-aware Augmented Reality in Indoor Scenes based
  on 3D Scene Graph","In this paper, we present Retargetable AR, a novel AR framework that yields
an AR experience that is aware of scene contexts set in various real
environments, achieving natural interaction between the virtual and real
worlds. To this end, we characterize scene contexts with relationships among
objects in 3D space, not with coordinates transformations. A context assumed by
an AR content and a context formed by a real environment where users experience
AR are represented as abstract graph representations, i.e. scene graphs. From
RGB-D streams, our framework generates a volumetric map in which geometric and
semantic information of a scene are integrated. Moreover, using the semantic
map, we abstract scene objects as oriented bounding boxes and estimate their
orientations. With such a scene representation, our framework constructs, in an
online fashion, a 3D scene graph characterizing the context of a real
environment for AR. The correspondence between the constructed graph and an AR
scene graph denoting the context of AR content provides a semantically
registered content arrangement, which facilitates natural interaction between
the virtual and real worlds. We performed extensive evaluations on our
prototype system through quantitative evaluation of the performance of the
oriented bounding box estimation, subjective evaluation of the AR content
arrangement based on constructed 3D scene graphs, and an online AR
demonstration. The results of these evaluations showed the effectiveness of our
framework, demonstrating that it can provide a context-aware AR experience in a

"Long-Term Evolution of Magnetic Fields in Flaring Active Region NOAA
  12673","During the lifetime of AR 12673, its magnetic field evolved drastically and
produced numerous large flares. In this study, using full maps of the Sun
observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial Relations
Observatory, we identified that AR 12673 emerged in decayed AR 12665, which had
survived for two solar rotations. Although both ARs emerged at the same
location, they possessed different characteristics and different flare
productivities. Therefore, it is important to study the long-term magnetic
evolution of both ARs to identify the distinguishing characteristics of an AR
that can produce large solar flares. We used the Spaceweather Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager Active Region Patch data to investigate the evolution of the
photospheric magnetic field and other physical properties of the recurring ARs
during five Carrington rotations. All these investigated parameters dynamically
evolved through a series of solar rotations. We compared the long-term
evolution of AR 12665 and AR 12673 to understand the differences in their
flare-producing properties. We also studied the relation of the long-term
evolution of these ARs with the presence of active longitude. We found that the
magnetic flux and complexity of AR 12673 developed much faster than those of AR
12665. Our results confirmed that a strong emerging flux that emerged in the
pre-existing AR near the active longitude created a very strong and complex AR
that produced large flares.","['Johan Muhamad', 'Muhamad Zamzam Nurzaman', 'Tiar Dani', 'Arun Relung Pamutri']",2021-10-14T13:59:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07369v1
Saliency in Augmented Reality,"With the rapid development of multimedia technology, Augmented Reality (AR)
has become a promising next-generation mobile platform. The primary theory
underlying AR is human visual confusion, which allows users to perceive the
real-world scenes and augmented contents (virtual-world scenes) simultaneously
by superimposing them together. To achieve good Quality of Experience (QoE), it
is important to understand the interaction between two scenarios, and
harmoniously display AR contents. However, studies on how this superimposition
will influence the human visual attention are lacking. Therefore, in this
paper, we mainly analyze the interaction effect between background (BG) scenes
and AR contents, and study the saliency prediction problem in AR. Specifically,
we first construct a Saliency in AR Dataset (SARD), which contains 450 BG
images, 450 AR images, as well as 1350 superimposed images generated by
superimposing BG and AR images in pair with three mixing levels. A large-scale
eye-tracking experiment among 60 subjects is conducted to collect eye movement
data. To better predict the saliency in AR, we propose a vector quantized
saliency prediction method and generalize it for AR saliency prediction. For
comparison, three benchmark methods are proposed and evaluated together with
our proposed method on our SARD. Experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method on both of the common saliency prediction
problem and the AR saliency prediction problem over benchmark methods. Our

"Magnetic fluxes of solar active regions of different
  magneto-morphological classes: I. Cyclic variations","Data for 3046 solar active regions (ARs) observed since May 12, 1996 to
December 27, 2021 were utilized to explore how the magnetic fluxes from ARs of
different complexity follow the solar cycle. Magnetograms from the Michelson
Doppler Imager instrument on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and from
the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager instrument on the Solar Dynamics
Observatory were utilized. Each AR was classified as a regular bipolar AR
(classes A1 or A2), or as an irregular bipolar AR (class B1), or as a
multipolar AR (classes B2 or B3). Unipolar ARs were segregated into a specific
class U. We found the following results. Unsigned magnetic fluxes from ARs of
different classes evolve synchronously following the cycle, the correlation
coefficient between the flux curves varies in a range of (0.70 - 0.99). The
deepest solar minimum is observed simultaneously for all classes. Only the most
simple ARs were observed during a deepest minimum: A1- and B1-class ARs. The
overall shape of a cycle is governed by the regular ARs, whereas the fine
structure of a solar maximum is determined by the most complex irregular ARs.
Approximately equal amount of flux (45$-$50% of the total flux) is contributed
by the A-class and B-class ARs during a solar maximum. Thus, observations allow
us to conclude that the appearance of ARs with the magnetic flux above
10$^{21}$ Mx is caused by the solar dynamo that operates as a unique process
displaying the properties of a non-linear dynamical dissipative system with a
cyclic behaviour and unavoidable fluctuations.","['Valentina I. Abramenko', 'Regina A. Suleymanova', 'Anastasija V. Zhukova']",2022-12-14T09:08:04Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07115v1
"Towards a live homogeneous database of solar active regions based on
  SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI synoptic magnetograms. I. Automatic detection and
  calibration","Recent studies indicate that a small number of rogue solar active regions
(ARs) may have a significant impact on the end-of-cycle polar field and the
long-term behavior of solar activity. The impact of individual ARs can be
qualified based on their magnetic field distribution. This motivates us to
build a live homogeneous AR database in a series of papers. As the first of the
series, we develop a method to automatically detect ARs from 1996 onwards based
on SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI synoptic magnetograms. The method shows its advantages
in excluding decayed ARs and unipolar regions and being compatible with any
available synoptic magnetograms. The identified AR flux and area are calibrated
based on the co-temporal SDO/HMI and SOHO/MDI data. The homogeneity and
reliability of the database are further verified by comparing it with other
relevant databases. We find that ARs with weaker flux have a weaker cycle
dependence. Stronger ARs show the weaker cycle 24 compared with cycle 23.
Several basic parameters, namely, location, area, and flux of negative and
positive polarities of identified ARs are provided in the paper. This paves the
way for AR's new parameters quantifying the impact on the long-term behavior of
solar activity to be presented in the subsequent paper of the series. The
constantly updated database covering more than two full solar cycles will be
beneficial for the understanding and prediction of the solar cycle. The
database and the detection codes are accessible online.","['Ruihui Wang', 'Jie Jiang', 'Yukun Luo']",2023-08-14T03:15:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06914v1
"Magnetic helicity evolution during active region emergence and
  subsequent flare productivity","Aims. Solar active regions (ARs), which are formed by flux emergence, serve
as the primary sources of solar eruptions. However, the specific physical
mechanism that governs the emergence process and its relationship with flare
productivity remains to be thoroughly understood. Methods. We examined 136
emerging ARs, focusing on the evolution of their magnetic helicity and magnetic
energy during the emergence phase. Based on the relation between helicity
accumulation and magnetic flux evolution, we categorized the samples and
investigated their flare productivity. Results. The emerging ARs we studied can
be categorized into three types, Type-I, Type-II, and Type-III, and they
account for 52.2%, 25%, and 22.8% of the total number in our sample,
respectively. Type-I ARs exhibit a synchronous increase in both the magnetic
flux and magnetic helicity, while the magnetic helicity in Type-II ARs displays
a lag in increasing behind the magnetic flux. Type-III ARs show obvious
helicity injections of opposite signs. Significantly, 90% of the
flare-productive ARs (flare index > 6) were identified as Type-I ARs,
suggesting that this type of AR has a higher potential to become flare
productive. In contrast, Type-II and Type-III ARs exhibited a low and moderate
likelihood of becoming active, respectively. Our statistical analysis also
revealed that Type-I ARs accumulate more magnetic helicity and energy, far
beyond what is found in Type-II and Type-III ARs. Moreover, we observed that
flare-productive ARs consistently accumulate a significant amount of helicity
and energy during their emergence phase. Conclusions. These findings provide
valuable insight into the flux emergence phenomena, offering promising
possibilities for early-stage predictions of solar eruptions.","['Zheng Sun', 'Ting Li', 'Quan Wang', 'Shangbin Yang', 'Mei Zhang', 'Yajie Chen']",2024-03-27T08:45:33Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18354v1

be caused by a combination of forward sputtered (peened) built-in particles and
entrapped working gas atoms. While the former are assumed to hold a predominant
role, the effect of the latter on the interaction dynamics as well as thin film
properties are scarcely clarified (concurrent or causative). The inherent
overlay of the ion bombardment induced processes render an isolation of their
contribution impracticable. In this work, this issue is addressed by comparing
the results of two case studies on the sputter deposition of Al thin films in
Ar working gas. In the first run Ar atoms are fully retained. In the second run
they are artificially neglected, as implanted Ar atoms are assumed to outgas
anyhow and not alter the ongoing dynamics significantly. Both case studies have
in common that the consecutive impingement of 100 particles (i.e., Ar$^+$ ions,
Al atoms) onto Al(001) surfaces for ion energies in the range of 3 eV to 300 eV
as well as Al/Ar$^+$ flux ratios from 0 to 1 are considered. The surface
interactions are simulated by means of hybrid reactive molecular
dynamics/force-biased Monte Carlo simulations and characterized in terms of
mass density, Ar concentration, biaxial stress, shear stress, ring statistical
connectivity profile, Ar gas porosity, Al vacancy density, and
root-mean-squared roughness. Ultimately, implanted Ar atoms are found to form
subnanometer sized eventually outgassing clusters for ion energies exceeding
100 eV. They fundamentally govern a variety of surface processes (e.g., forward
sputtering/peening) and surface properties (e.g., compressive stresses) in the
considered operating regime.","['Tobias Gergs', 'Thomas Mussenbrock', 'Jan Trieschmann']",2021-10-01T12:41:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00356v2
Spectroscopic Diagnostic of the Footpoints of the Cool loops,"Statistically, the cool loop's footpoints are diagnosed using Si~{\sc iv}
resonance lines observations provided by Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph
(IRIS). The intensity and Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the loop's
footpoints in $\beta${--}$\gamma$ active regions (ARs) are higher than the
corresponding parameters of footpoints in $\beta$ ARs. However, the Doppler
velocity of footpoints in both ARs are almost similar to each other. The
intensities of footpoints from $\beta${--}$\gamma$ AR is found to be around 9
times that of $\beta$ AR when both ARs are observed nearly at the same time.
The same intensity difference reduces nearly to half (4 times) when considering
all ARs observed over 9 years. Hence, the instrument degradation affects
comparative intensity analysis. We find that Doppler velocity and FWHM are
well-correlated while peak intensity is neither correlated with Doppler
velocity nor FWHM. The loop's footpoints in $\beta$-$\gamma$ ARs have around
four times more complex Si~{\sc iv} spectral profiles than that of $\beta$ ARs.
The intensity ratios (Si~{\sc iv} 1393.78~{\AA}/1402.77~{\AA}) of the
significant locations of footpoints differ, marginally, (i.e., either less than
1.9 or greater than 2.10) from the theoretical ratio of 2, i.e., 52\% (55\%)
locations in $\beta$ ($\beta${--}$\gamma$) ARs significantly deviate from 2.
Hence, we say that more than half of the footpoint locations are either
affected by the opacity or resonance scattering. We conclude that the nature
and attributes of the footpoints of the cool loops in $\beta$-$\gamma$ ARs are
significantly different from those in $\beta$ ARs.","['B. Suresh Babu', 'Pradeep Kayshap', 'Sharad C. Tripathi', 'P. Jelinek', 'B. N. Dwivedi']",2024-01-13T08:12:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07005v1
Luminosities of AGB Variables,"The prevailing evidence suggests that most large-amplitude AGB variables
follow the period luminosity (PL) relation that has been established for Miras
in the LMC and galactic globular clusters. Hipparcos observations indicate that
most Miras in the solar neighbourhood are consistent with such a relation.
There are two groups of stars with luminosities that are apparently greater
than the PL relation would predict: (1) in the LMC and SMC there are large
amplitude variables, with long periods, P> 420 days, which are probably
undergoing hot bottom burning, but which are very clearly more luminous than
the PL relation (these are visually bright and are likely to be among the first
stars discovered in more distant intermediate age populations); (2) in the
solar neighbourhood there are short period, P<235 days, red stars which are
probably more luminous than the PL relation. Similar short-period red stars,
with high luminosities, have not been identified in the Magellanic Clouds.",['Patricia Whitelock'],2002-07-08T15:47:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0207168v1
Quarkonium production and decays,"Quarkonium decays are studied in the charmonium model. Relativistic
corrections, higher-order perturbative QCD corrections and non- perturbative
contributions are discussed. Recent measurements of charmonium annihilation
rates are used to evaluate the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$
simultaneously with the wave functions (and their derivatives) at the origin.
Further predictions are made for yet unobserved decay rates. The various models
for quarkonium production in hadronic collisions are critically reviewed. Based
on the charmonium model, the cross sections of different quarkonium states are
given in a well-defined QCD perturbation series, including quark--antiquark,
quark--gluon, and gluon--gluon scatterings. Numerical estimates are given for
charmonium production in $\p\p$, $\ppbar$, and $\pi\p$ collisions. The role of
indirect $\JP$ production via $\chi_{\c J}(1P)$, $\eta_{\c}(2S)$, $\psi(2S)$
and $\b$-decays is pointed out. Relativistic effects and non-perturbative
contributions are found to be important. Existing measurements are compiled and
shown to be well explained if all contributions are included. The ${}^1S_0$
cross section is calculated in complete next-to-leading order. Finally, a study
of the high-energy behaviour of quarkonium cross sections is made, based on the
asymptotical behaviour of higher-order QCD corrections.",['G. A. Schuler'],1994-03-29T15:51:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9403387v1
Determination of Decuplet Baryon Magnetic Moments from QCD Sum Rules,"A complete set of QCD sum rules for the magnetic moments of decuplet baryons
are derived using the external field method. They are analyzed thoroughly using
a Monte-Carlo based procedure. Valid sum rules are identified under the
criteria of OPE convergence and ground state dominance and their predictions
are obtained. The performances of these sum rules are further compared and a
favorable sum rule is designated for each member. Correlations between the
input and the output parameters are examined and large sensitivities to the
quark condensate magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ are found. Using realistic
estimates of the QCD input parameters, the uncertainties on the magnetic
moments are found relatively large and they can be attributed mostly to the
poorly-known $\chi$. It is shown that the accuracy can be improved to the 30%
level, provided the uncertainties in the QCD input parameters can be determined
to the 10% level. The computed magnetic moments are consistent with existing
data. Comparisons with other calculations are made.",['Frank X. Lee'],1997-08-12T14:46:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9708323v1
"Exact, E=0, Solutions for General Power-Law Potentials. II. Quantum Wave
  Functions","For zero energy, $E=0$, we derive exact, quantum solutions for {\it all}
power-law potentials, $V(r) = -\gamma/r^{\nu}$, with $\gamma > 0$ and $-\infty
< \nu < \infty$. The solutions are, in general, Bessel functions of powers of
$r$. For $\nu > 2$ and $l \ge 1$ the solutions are normalizable; they
correspond to states which are bound by the angular-momentum barrier.
Surprisingly, the solutions for $\nu < -2$ are also normalizable, They are
discrete states but do not correspond to bound states. For $2> \nu \geq -2$ the
states are unnormalizable continuum states. The $\nu=2$ solutions are also
unnormalizable, but are exceptional solutions. Finally, we find that by
increasing the dimension of the \seq beyond 4 an effective centrifugal barrier
is created, due solely to the extra dimensions, which is enough to cause
binding. Thus, if $D>4$, there are $E=0$ bound states for $\nu > 2$ even for
$l=0$. We discuss the physics of the above solutions are compare them to the
classical solutions of the preceding paper.","['Jamil Daboul', 'Michael Martin Nieto']",1994-08-09T20:10:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9408058v1
From Sparks to Grundles--Differential Characters,"We introduce a new homological machine for the study of secondary geometric
invariants. The objects, called spark complexes, occur in many areas of
mathematics. The theory is applied here to establish the equivalence of a large
family of spark complexes which appear naturally in geometry, topology and
physics. These complexes are quite different. Some of them are purely analytic,
some are simplicial, some are of Cech-type, and many are mixtures. However, the
associated theories of secondary invariants are all shown to be canonically
isomorphic. We also show that Differential characters factor to a much smaller,
more geometric group, the set of holonomy maps. Numerous applications and
examples are explored.","['Reese Harvey', 'H. Blaine Lawson Jr']",2003-06-11T20:46:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0306193v3

  Specifically, we present findings from creating AR prototypes in a handheld
AR setting. In a first user study, we found that a tangible AR prototype
resulted in higher hedonistic measures than a camera-based approach. In a
follow up study, we compared the tangible AR prototype with a non-AR
touchscreen version for selection, scaling, translation and rotation tasks in a

Numerical methods for thermally stressed shallow shell equations,"We develop efficient and accurate numerical methods to solve a class of
shallow shell problems of the von Karman type. The governing equations form a
fourth-order coupled system of nonlinear biharnomic equations for the
transverse deflection and Airy's stress function. A second-order finite
difference discretization with three iterative methods (Picard, Newton and
Trust-Region Dogleg) are proposed for the numerical solution of the nonlinear
PDE system. Three simple boundary conditions and two application-motivated
mixed boundary conditions are considered. Along with the nonlinearity of the
system, boundary singularities that appear when mixed boundary conditions are
specified are the main numerical challenges. Two approaches that use either a
transition function or local corrections are developed to deal with these
boundary singularities. All the proposed numerical methods are validated using
carefully designed numerical tests, where expected orders of accuracy and rates
of convergence are observed. A rough run-time performance comparison is also
conducted to illustrate the efficiency of our methods. As an application of the
methods, a snap-through thermal buckling problem is considered. The critical
thermal loads of shell buckling with various boundary conditions are
numerically calculated, and snap-through bifurcation curves are also obtained
using our numerical methods together with a pseudo-arclength continuation
method. Our results are consistent with previous studies.","['Hangjie Ji', 'Longfei Li']",2017-12-08T19:51:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03269v1

"Magnetic Reconnection along Quasi-Separatrix Layers as a Driver of
  Ubiquitous Active Region Outflows","Hinode's EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) has discovered ubiquitous outflows of
a few to 50 km/sec from active regions (ARs). These outflows are most prominent
at the AR boundary and appear over monopolar magnetic areas. They are linked to
strong non-thermal line broadening and are stronger in hotter EUV lines. The
outflows persist for at least several days. Using Hinode EIS and X-Ray
Telescope observations of AR 10942 coupled with magnetic modeling, we
demonstrate that the outflows originate from specific locations of the magnetic
topology where field lines display strong gradients of magnetic connectivity,
namely quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), or in the limit of infinitely thin QSLs,
separatrices. We found the strongest AR outflows to be in the vicinity of QSL
sections located over areas of strong magnetic field. We argue that magnetic
reconnection at QSLs separating closed field lines of the AR and either
large-scale externally connected or `open' field lines is a viable mechanism
for driving AR outflows which are likely sources of the slow solar wind.","['D. Baker', 'L. van Driel-Gesztelyi', 'C. H. Mandrini', 'P. Demoulin', 'M. J. Murray']",2009-09-25T16:46:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4738v1
Propensity score-based estimators with multiple error-prone covariates,"Propensity score methods are an important tool to help reduce confounding in
non-experimental studies. Most propensity score methods assume that covariates
are measured without error. However, covariates are often measured with error,
which leads to biased causal effect estimates if the true underlying covariates
are the actual confounders. Although some studies have investigated the impact
of a single mismeasured covariate on estimating a causal effect and proposed
methods for handling the measurement error, almost no work exists investigating
the case where multiple covariates are mismeasured. In this paper, we examine
the consequences of multiple error-prone covariates when estimating causal
effects using propensity score-based estimators via extensive simulation
studies and real data analyses. We find that causal effect estimates are less
biased when the propensity score model includes mismeasured covariates whose
true underlying values are strongly correlated with each other. However, when
the measurement \emph{errors} are correlated with each other, additional bias
is introduced. In addition, it is beneficial to include correctly measured
auxiliary variables that are correlated with confounders whose true underlying
values are mismeasured in the propensity score model.","['Hwanhee Hong', 'David A. Aaby', 'Juned Siddique', 'Elizabeth A. Stuart']",2017-06-07T17:55:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02283v1
Geometric variational principles for computational homogenization,"The homogenization of periodic elastic composites is addressed through the
reformulation of the local equations of the mechanical problem in a geometric
functional setting. This relies on the definition of Hilbert spaces of
kinematically and statically admissible tensor fields, whose orthogonality and
duality properties are recalled. These are endowed with specific energetic
scalar products that make use of a reference and uniform elasticity tensor. The
corresponding strain and stress Green's operators are introduced and
interpreted as orthogonal projection operators in the admissibility spaces. In
this context and as an alternative to classical minimum energy principles, two
geometric variational principles are investigated with the introduction of
functionals that aim at measuring the discrepancy of arbitrary test fields to
the kinematic, static or material admissibility conditions of the problem. By
relaxing the corresponding local equations, this study aims in particular at
laying the groundwork for the homogenization of composites whose constitutive
properties are only partially known or uncertain. The local fields in the
composite and their macroscopic responses are computed through the minimization
of the proposed geometric functionals. To do so, their gradients are computed
using the Green's operators and gradient-based optimization schemes are
discussed. A FFT-based implementation of these schemes is proposed and they are
assessed numerically on a canonical example for which analytical solutions are
available.","['Cedric Bellis', 'Pierre Suquet']",2018-11-27T13:16:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02729v1
"Novel, simple and robust contact-discontinuity capturing schemes for
  high speed compressible flows","The nonlinear convection terms in the governing equations of compressible
fluid flows are hyperbolic in nature and are nontrivial for modelling and
numerical simulation. Many numerical methods have been developed in the last
few decades for this purpose and are typically based on Riemann solvers, which
are strongly dependent on the underlying eigen-structure of the governing
equations. Objective of the present work is to develop simple algorithms which
are not dependent on the eigen-structure and yet can tackle easily the
hyperbolic parts. Central schemes with smart diffusion mechanisms are apt for
this purpose. For fixing the numerical diffusion, the basic ideas of satisfying
the Rankine-Hugoniot (RH) conditions along with generalized Riemann invariants
are proposed. Two such interesting algorithms are presented, which capture
grid-aligned steady contact discontinuities exactly and yet have sufficient
numerical diffusion to avoid numerical shock instabilities. Both the algorithms
presented are robust in avoiding shock instabilities, apart from being accurate
in capturing contact discontinuities, do not need wave speed corrections and
are independent of eigen-strutures of the underlying hyperbolic parts of the
systems.","['Ramesh Kolluru', 'N. Venkata Raghavendra', 'S. V. Raghurama Rao', 'G. N. Sekha']",2020-03-24T07:28:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10695v1

"On simple classes of special generic maps and round fold maps and fold

dimensional variants of Morse functions. Classes of special generic maps and
round fold maps are important classes of fold maps. {\it Special generic} maps
are higher dimensional variants of Morse functions on homotopy spheres with
exactly two {\it singular points}: canonical projections of unit spheres are
special generic. Round fold maps are Morse functions obtained as doubles of
Morse functions, or fold maps such that the set of all the singular points are
embeddings and that the images are concentric. In the present paper, we discuss
compositions of these maps with canonical projections. For example, we observe
that these compositions for special generic maps of simple classes are regarded
as round fold maps in considerable cases. We also present round fold maps we
cannot represent in this way, seeming to be represented so. Note that such
compositions are natural operations in related theory of differentiable maps.",['Naoki Kitazawa'],2021-05-02T23:35:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00575v2
Flux emergence and generation of flare-productive active regions,"Solar flares and coronal mass ejections are among the most prominent

Are Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell wormholes traversable?,"Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell wormholes are asymptotically flat static wormhole
solutions in general relativity that do not make use of exotic matter. The
asymmetric static solutions are smooth, are regular everywhere, and violate the
null energy condition, which suggests that they are traversable. To determine
if in fact they are traversable, we numerically evolve the static solutions
forward in time. In all cases considered, our simulations indicate that black
holes form that are connected by the wormhole. Although there exist null

"Evaluating Augmented Reality Communication: How Can We Teach Procedural
  Skill in AR?","Augmented reality (AR) has great potential for use in healthcare
applications, especially remote medical training and supervision. In this
paper, we analyze the usage of an AR communication system to teach a medical
procedure, the placement of a central venous catheter (CVC) under ultrasound
guidance. We examine various AR communication and collaboration components,
including gestural communication, volumetric information, annotations,
augmented objects, and augmented screens. We compare how teaching in AR differs
from teaching through videoconferencing-based communication. Our results
include a detailed medical training steps analysis in which we compare how
verbal and visual communication differs between video and AR training. We
identify procedural steps in which medical experts give visual instructions
utilizing AR components. We examine the change in AR usage and interaction over
time and recognize patterns between users. Moreover, AR design recommendations
are given based on post-training interviews.","['Manuel Rebol', 'Krzysztof Pietroszek', 'Neal Sikka', 'Claudia Ranniger', 'Colton Hood', 'Adam Rutenberg', 'Puja Sasankan', 'Christian Gütl']",2023-12-14T17:22:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09152v1
"One Stone, Two Birds: Using Vapor Kinetic Energy to Detect and
  Understand Atmospheric Rivers","Poleward water vapor transport in the midlatitudes mainly occurs in
meandering filaments of intense water vapor transport, spanning thousands of
kilometers long and hundreds of kilometers wide and drifting eastward. The
water vapor filaments are known as atmospheric rivers (ARs). They can cause
extreme wind gusts, intense precipitation, and flooding along densely populated
coastal regions. Many recent studies about ARs focused on the statistical
analyses of ARs, but a process-level understanding of ARs remains elusive. Here
we show that ARs are streams of air with enhanced vapor kinetic energy (VKE)
and derive a governing equation for Integrated VKE (IVKE) to understand what
contributes to the evolution of ARs. We find that ARs grow mainly because of
potential energy conversion to kinetic energy, decay largely owing to
condensation and turbulence, and the eastward drift is primarily due to
horizontal advection of VKE. Our VKE framework complements the integrated vapor
transport framework, which is popular for identifying ARs but lacks a
prognostic equation for understanding the physical processes.","['Hing Ong', 'Da Yang']",2024-03-31T19:04:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00772v1
"The Clarkston AR Gateways Project: Anchoring Refugee Presence and
  Narratives in a Small Town","This paper outlines the Clarkston AR Gateways Project, a speculative process
and artifact entering its second phase, where Augmented Reality (AR) will be
used to amplify the diverse narratives of Clarkston, Georgia's refugee
community. Focused on anchoring their stories and presence into the town's
physical and digital landscapes, the project employs a participatory co-design
approach, engaging directly with community members. This placemaking effort
aims to uplift refugees by teaching them AR development skills that help them
more autonomously express and elevate their voices through public art. The
result is hoped to be AR experiences that not only challenge prevailing
narratives but also celebrate the tapestry of cultures in the small town. This
work is supported through AR's unique affordance for users to situate their
experiences as interactive narratives within public spaces. Such site-specific
AR interactive stories can encourage interactions within those spaces that
shift how they are conceived, perceived, and experienced. This process of
refugee-driven AR creation reflexively alters the space and affirms their
presence and agency. The project's second phase aims to establish a model
adaptable to diverse, refugee-inclusive communities, demonstrating how AR
storytelling can be a powerful tool for cultural orientation and celebration.","['Joshua A. Fisher', 'Fernando Rochaix']",2024-04-12T00:58:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08179v1
Some geometric aspects of variational problems in fibred manifolds,"This work contains an exposition of foundations of the variational calculus
in fibered manifolds. The emphasis is laid on the geometric aspects of the
theory. Especially functionals defined by real functions (Lagrange functions)
or differential forms (Lagrangian forms) on the first jet prolongation of a
given fibered manifold are studied. Critical points (critical cross sections)
of the functionals are examined and the Euler equations for them are derived in
a completely invariant manner. The first variation formula is derived by means
of the so-called Lepagian forms. All variations appearing in the theory are
generated by vector fields. Jet prolongations of projectable vector fields are
defined. The Euler form, associated with a given Lagrange function (of
Lagrangian form) is introduced by means of the Euler equations of the calculus
of variations. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the vanishing of the
Euler form are stated in terms of differential forms and their exterior
differential. The corresponding conditions for a Lagrange function leading to
identically vanishing Euler equations are given. Some special Lepagian forms
are studied. Classes of symmetries of a variational problem are defined.
Invariant, generalized invariant, and symmetry transformations are
characterized in terms of the Lie derivatives. The variational problem with
prescribed symmetry transformations is formulated, and necessary and sufficient
conditions for its solutions are studied. The geometrical aspects of the
so-called generally covariant variational theories are studied. Definitions and
theorems are well adapted to the situation in physical field theories.",['Demeter Krupka'],2001-10-02T13:31:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0110005v2
"YSO jets in the Galactic Plane from UWISH2: III - Jets and Outflows in
  Cassiopeia and Auriga","We present the analysis of 35.5 square degrees of images in the 1-0S(1) line
of H2 from the UK Widefield Infrared Survey for H2 (UWISH2) towards Cassiopeia
and Auriga. We have identified 98 Molecular Hydrogen emission-line Objects
(MHOs) driven by Young Stellar Objects, 60% of which are bipolar outflows and
all are new discoveries. We estimate that the UWISH2 extended emission object
catalogue contains fewer than % false positives and is complete at the 95%
level for jets and outflows brighter than the UWISH2 detection limit. We
identified reliable driving source candidates for three quarters of the
detected outflows, 40% of which are associated with groups and clusters of
stars. The driving source candidates are 20% protostars, the remainder are
CTTSs. We also identified 15 new star cluster candidates near MHOs in the
survey area.
  We find that the typical outflow identified in the sample has the following
characteristics: the position angles are randomly orientated; bipolar outflows
are straight within a few degrees; the two lobes are slightly asymmetrical in
length and brightness; the length and brightness of the lobes are not
correlated; typical time gaps between major ejections of material are 1-3kyr,
hence FU-Ori or EX-Ori eruptions are most likely not the cause of these, but we
suggest MNors as a possible source. Furthermore, we find that outflow lobe
length distributions are statistically different from the widely used total
length distributions. There are a larger than expected number of bright
outflows indicating that the flux distribution does not follow a power law.","['D. Froebrich', 'S. V. Makin']",2016-07-18T12:50:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05049v1
Maxwell Matters,"Charges are everywhere because most atoms are charged. Chemical bonds are
formed by electrons with their charge. Charges move and interact according to
Maxwell's equations in space and in atoms where the equations of
electrodynamics are embedded in Schroedinger's equation as the potential.
Maxwell's equations are universal, valid inside atoms and between stars from
times much shorter than those of atomic motion (0.1 femtoseconds) to years (32
mega-seconds). Maxwell's equations enforce the conservation of current.
Analysis shows that the electric field can take on whatever value is needed to
ensure conservation of current. The properties of matter rearrange themselves
to satisfy Maxwell's equations and conservation of current. Conservation of
current is as universal as Maxwell's equations themselves. Yet equations of
electrodynamics find little place in the literature of material physics,
chemistry, or biochemistry. Kinetic models of chemistry and Markov treatments
of atomic motion are ordinary differential equations in time and do not satisfy
conservation of current unless modified significantly. Systems at equilibrium,
without macroscopic flow, have thermal fluctuating currents that are conserved
according to the Maxwell equations although their macroscopic averages are
zero. The macroscopic consequences of atomic scale fluctuating thermal currents
are not known but are likely to be substantial because of the nonlinear
interactions in systems like these, in which 'everything interacts with
everything else'.
  Conclusion: current needs to be conserved in models of material systems, even
in simplified versions.",['Bob Eisenberg'],2016-07-19T12:53:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06691v4
"Different contributions to space weather and space climate from
  different big solar active regions","The purpose of this paper is to show that large active regions (ARs) with
different magnetic configurations have different contributions to short-term
and long-term variations of the Sun. As a case study, the complex $\delta$-type
AR 12673 and the simple $\beta$-type AR 12674 are investigated in detail. Since
the axial dipole moment at cycle minimum determines the amplitude of the
subsequent cycle and space climate, we have assimilated the individual observed
magnetic configurations of these two ARs into a surface flux transport model to
compare their contributions to the axial dipole moment $D$. We find that AR
12673 has a significant effect on $D$ at the end of the cycle, making it weaker
because of the abnormal and complicated magnetic polarities. An initial
strongly positive $D$ ends up with a strongly negative value. The flare-poor AR
12674 has a greater contribution to the long-term axial dipole moment than the
flare-rich AR 12673. We then carry out a statistical analysis of ARs larger
than 800 $\mu$Hem from 1976 to 2017. We use the flare index FI and define an
axial dipole moment index DI to quantify the effects of each AR on space
weather and space climate, respectively. Whereas the FI has a strong dependence
on the magnetic configuration, the DI shows no such dependence. The DI is
mainly determined by the latitudinal location and the latitudinal separation of
the positive and negative magnetic fluxes of the ARs. Simple ARs have the same
possibility as complex ARs to produce big DI values affecting space climate.","['Jie Jiang', 'Qiao Song', 'Jing-Xiu Wang', 'Tunde Baranyi']",2019-01-01T08:44:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00116v1
"Will $^{37}$Ar emissions from light water power reactors become an
  obstacle to its use for nuclear explosion monitoring?","$^{37}$Ar is a promising candidate for complementing radioxenon isotopes as
indicators of underground nuclear explosions. This study evaluates its
potential anthropogenic background caused by emissions from commercial
pressurised water reactors. Various $^{37}$Ar production pathways, which result
from activation of $^{36}$Ar and of $^{40}$Ca, respectively, are identified and
their emissions quantified. In-core processes include (1) the restart of
operation and degassing of the primary cooling water after maintenance and
refueling shutdown, (2) the replacement of primary coolant water for limiting
its tritium concentrations, and (3) the leakage of $^{37}$Ar produced from
calcium impurities in UO$_{2}$ after fuel rod failures. Activation of air and
of calcium in concrete within the biological shield are major out-of-core
production pathways. Whereas emissions from in-core processes are transient, a
rather constant $^{37}$Ar source term results from its out-of-core production.
Generic atmospheric dispersion simulations indicate that already at moderate
distances from the emitter, concentrations of $^{37}$Ar caused by routine
reactor operations are far below its cosmogenic background in air. The only
exception results from an inadvertent reactor re-start without operation of the
primary cooling water degassing system for prolonged time. Such an event also
causes high emissions of $^{41}$Ar which can be used for discriminating its
$^{37}$Ar signal from an underground nuclear explosion.","['Gerald Kirchner', 'Franziska Gerfen', 'Anna Heise', 'Timo Schlüschen']",2020-06-04T12:53:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02823v1
"Fault Location Estimation by Using Machine Learning Methods in Mixed
  Transmission Lines","Overhead lines are generally used for electrical energy transmission. Also,
XLPE underground cable lines are generally used in the city center and the
crowded areas to provide electrical safety, so high voltage underground cable
lines are used together with overhead line in the transmission lines, and these
lines are called as the mixed lines. The distance protection relays are used to
determine the impedance based fault location according to the current and
voltage magnitudes in the transmission lines. However, the fault location
cannot be correctly detected in mixed transmission lines due to different
characteristic impedance per unit length because the characteristic impedance
of high voltage cable line is significantly different from overhead line. Thus,
determinations of the fault section and location with the distance protection
relays are difficult in the mixed transmission lines. In this study, 154 kV
overhead transmission line and underground cable line are examined as the mixed
transmission line for the distance protection relays. Phase to ground faults
are created in the mixed transmission line, and overhead line section and
underground cable section are simulated by using PSCAD. The short circuit fault
images are generated in the distance protection relay for the overhead
transmission line and underground cable transmission line faults. The images
include the RX impedance diagram of the fault, and the RX impedance diagram
have been detected by applying image processing steps. The regression methods
are used for prediction of the fault location, and the results of image
processing are used as the input parameters for the training process of the
regression methods. The results of regression methods are compared to select
the most suitable method at the end of this study for forecasting of the fault
location in transmission lines.","['Serkan Budak', 'Bahadir Akbal']",2020-11-06T08:56:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03238v1
"The Missing Cool Corona in the Flat Magnetic Field around Solar Active
  Regions","SDO/AIA images the full solar disk in several EUV bands that are each
sensitive to coronal plasma emissions of one or more specific temperatures. We
observe that when isolated active regions (ARs) are on the disk, full-disk
images in some of the coronal EUV channels show the outskirts of the AR as a
dark moat surrounding the AR. Here we present seven specific examples, selected
from time periods when there was only a single AR present on the disk.
Visually, we observe the moat to be most prominent in the AIA 171 Angstrom
band, which has the most sensitivity to emission from plasma at log10 T = 5.8.
By examining the 1D line-of-sight emission measure temperature distribution
found from six AIA EUV channels, we find the intensity of the moat to be most
depressed over the temperature range log10 T ~ 5.7 - 6.2 for most of the cases.
We argue that the dark moat exists because the pressure from the strong
magnetic field that splays out from the AR presses down on underlying magnetic
loops, flattening those loops -- along with the lowest of the AR's own loops
over the moat -- to a low altitude. Those loops, which would normally emit the
bulk of the 171 Angstrom emission, are restricted to heights above the surface
that are too low to have 171 Angstrom-emitting plasmas sustained in them,
according to Antiochos & Noci (1986), while hotter EUV-emitting plasmas are
sustained in the overlying higher-altitude long AR-rooted coronal loops. This
potentially explains the low-coronal-temperature dark moats surrounding the
ARs.","['Talwinder Singh', 'Alphonse C. Sterling', 'Ronald L. Moore']",2020-12-31T02:39:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15406v1
How rare are counter Evershed flows?,"One of the main characteristics of the penumbra of sunspots is the radially
outward-directed Evershed flow. Only recently have penumbral regions been
reported with similar characteristics to normal penumbral filaments, but with
an opposite direction of the flow. Such flows directed towards the umbra are
known as counter Evershed flows (CEFs). We aim to determine the frequency of
occurrence of CEFs in active regions (ARs) and to characterize their lifetime
and the prevailing conditions in the ARs. We analysed the continuum images,
Dopplergrams, and magnetograms recorded by SDO/HMI of 97 ARs that appeared from
2011 to 2017. We followed the ARs for $9.6\pm1.4$ days on average. We found 384
CEFs in total, with a median value of 6 CEFs per AR. CEFs are a rather common
feature, they occur in 83.5% of all ARs regardless of the magnetic complexity
of the AR. However, CEFs were observed on average only during 5.9% of the mean
total duration of all the observations analyzed here. The lifetime of CEFs
follows a log-normal distribution with a median value of 10.6$_{-6.0}^{+12.4}$
hr. In addition, we report two populations of CEFs depending on whether they
are associated with light bridges, or not. We explain that the rarity of
reports of CEFs in the literature is a result of highly incomplete coverage of
ARs with spectropolarimetric data. By using the continuous observations now
routinely available from space, we are able to overcome this limitation.","['J. Sebastián Castellanos Durán', 'Andreas Lagg', 'Sami K. Solanki']",2021-06-10T08:53:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05592v1
"Virtual and Augmented Reality-Based Assistive Interfaces for Upper-limb
  Prosthesis Control and Rehabilitation","Functional upper-limb prosthetic training can improve users performance in
controlling prostheses and has been incorporated into occupational therapy for
individuals in need. In recent years, virtual reality (VR) and augmented
reality (AR) technologies have been shown to be promising avenues to improve
the convenience of rehabilitative prosthesis training systems. However, it is
uncertain if the comprehensive efficacy and effectiveness of VR or AR assistive
tools are adequate compared to conventional prosthetic tools and if not,
whether enhancements can be made through incorporation of other technical
paradigms.
  This work first presents a mixed reality system we developed for prosthesis
control and training. Five able-bodied subjects are involved to perform
three-dimensional object manipulation tasks in analogous AR and VR
environments. Multiple evaluation metrics are applied to assess subjects
performances within the two paradigms. Based on the comparative analysis, we
find that VR-based environment promotes more efficient motion along with higher
task completion rate and path efficiency while AR paradigm allows subjects to
perform motor tasks with shorter time consumed. Another study is conducted to
evaluate the efficiency and feasibility of AR-facilitated prosthesis control
system compared to that in real-world and if any technical additions can be
applied to improve the AR-based system. Three able-bodied subjects were engaged
in the experiment to perform object manipulation tasks in a) physical
environment, b) AR-without-bypass environment, and c) AR-with-bypass
environment. Based on the results obtained from the assessment, we conclude
that while our AR-based system modestly lags behind the effectiveness of
physical systems, the study conducted using a bypass prosthesis suggests that
AR system has the potential to improve the efficacy of prosthesis control.",['Yinghe Sun'],2022-04-28T03:26:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02227v1
What determines active region coronal plasma composition?,"The chemical composition of the solar corona is different from that of the
solar photosphere, with the strongest variation being observed in active
regions (ARs). Using data from the Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Imaging
Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode, we present a survey of coronal elemental
composition as expressed in the first ionisation potential (FIP) bias in 28 ARs
of different ages and magnetic flux content, which are at different stages in
their evolution. We find no correlation between the FIP bias of an AR and its
total unsigned magnetic flux or age. However, there is a weak dependence of FIP
bias on the evolutionary stage, decreasing from 1.9-2.2 in ARs with spots to
1.5-1.6 in ARs that are at more advanced stages of the decay phase. FIP bias
shows an increasing trend with average magnetic flux density up to 200 G but
this trend does not continue at higher values. The FIP bias distribution within
ARs has a spread between 0.4 and 1. The largest spread is observed in very
dispersed ARs. We attribute this to a range of physical processes taking place
in these ARs including processes associated with filament channel formation.
These findings indicate that, while some general trends can be observed, the
processes influencing the composition of an AR are complex and specific to its
evolution, magnetic configuration or environment. The spread of FIP bias values
in ARs shows a broad match with that previously observed in situ in the slow
solar wind.","['Teodora Mihailescu', 'Deborah Baker', 'Lucie M. Green', 'Lidia van Driel-Gesztelyi', 'David M. Long', 'David H. Brooks', 'Andy S. H. To']",2022-05-10T16:40:40Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05027v1
Nature of helicity injection in non-erupting solar active regions,"Using time-sequence vector magnetic field and coronal observations from
\textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory}, we report the observations of the magnetic
field evolution and coronal activity in four emerging active regions (ARs). The
ARs emerge with leading polarity being the same as for the majority of ARs in a
hemisphere of solar cycle 24. After emergence, the magnetic polarities separate
each other without building a sheared polarity inversion line. In all four ARs,
the magnetic fields are driven by foot point motions such that the sign of the
helicity injection ($dH/dt$) in the first half of the evolution is changed to
the opposite sign in the later part of the observation time. This successive
injection of opposite helicity is also consistent with the sign of mean
force-free twist parameter ($\alpha_{av}$). Further, the EUV light curves of
the ARs in 94\AA~and GOES X-ray flux reveal flaring activity below C-class
magnitude. Importantly, the white-light coronagraph images in conjunction with
the AR images in AIA 94 \AA~delineate the absence of associated CMEs with the
studied ARs. These observations imply that the ARs with successive injection of
opposite sign magnetic helicity are not favorable to twisted flux rope
formation with excess coronal helicity, and therefore are unable to launch
CMEs, according to recent reports. This study provides the characteristics of
helicity flux evolution in the ARs referring to the conservative property of
magnetic helicity and more such studies would help to quantify the eruptive
capability of a given AR.",['P. Vemareddy'],2022-08-05T15:24:21Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03228v1
Politopality of 2-orbit maniplexes,"Abstract polytopes are a combinatorial generalization of convex and skeletal
polytopes. Counting how many flag orbits a polytope has under its automorphism
group is a way of measuring how symmetric it is. Polytopes with one flag orbit
are called regular and are very well known. Polytopes with two flag orbits
(called 2-orbit polytopes) are, however, way more elusive. There are $2^n-1$
possible classes of 2-orbit polytopes in rank (dimension) $n$, but for most of
those classes, determining whether or not they are empty is still an open
problem. In 2019, in their article An existence result on two-orbit maniplexes,
Pellicer, Poto\v{c}nik and Toledo constructed 2-orbit maniplexes (objects that
generalize abstract polytopes and maps) in all these classes, but the question
of whether or not they are also polytopes remained open. In this paper we use
the results of a previous paper by the author and Hubard to show that some of
these 2-orbit maniplexes are, in fact, polytopes. In particular we prove that
there are 2-orbit polytopes in all the classes where exactly two kinds of
reflections are forbidden. We use this to show that there are at least
$n^2-n+1$ classes of 2-orbit polytopes of rank $n$ that are not empty. We also
show that the maniplexes constructed with this method in the remaining classes
satisfy all but (possibly) one of the properties necessary to be polytopes,
therefore we get closer to proving that there are 2-orbit polytopes in all the
classes.",['Elías Mochán'],2023-09-27T17:09:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15791v3
"Counting Subnetworks Under Gene Duplication in Genetic Regulatory
  Networks","Gene duplication is a fundamental evolutionary mechanism that contributes to
biological complexity and diversity (Fortna et al., 2004). Traditionally,
research has focused on the duplication of gene sequences (Zhang, 1914).
However, evidence suggests that the duplication of regulatory elements may also
play a significant role in the evolution of genomic functions (Teichmann and
Babu, 2004; Hallin and Landry, 2019). In this work, the evolution of regulatory
relationships belonging to gene-specific-substructures in a GRN are modeled. In
the model, a network grows from an initial configuration by repeatedly choosing
a random gene to duplicate. The likelihood that the regulatory relationships
associated with the selected gene are retained through duplication is
determined by a vector of probabilities. Occurrences of gene-family-specific
substructures are counted under the gene duplication model. In this thesis,
gene-family-specific substructures are referred to as subnetwork motifs. These
subnetwork motifs are motivated by network motifs which are patterns of
interconnections that recur more often in a specialized network than in a
random network (Milo et al., 2002). Subnetwork motifs differ from network
motifs in the way that subnetwork motifs are instances of gene-family-specific
substructures while network motifs are isomorphic substructures. These
subnetwork motifs are counted under Full and Partial Duplication, which differ
in the way in which regulation relationships are inherited. Full duplication
occurs when all regulatory links are inherited at each duplication step, and
Partial Duplication occurs when regulation inheritance varies at each
duplication step. Moments for the number of occurrences of subnetwork motifs
are determined in each model. The results presented offer a method for
discovering subnetwork motifs that are significant in a GRN under gene
duplication.","['Ashley Scruse', 'Jonathan Arnold', 'Robert Robinson']",2024-05-06T03:55:54Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03148v1
"A Possible Universal Model without Singularity and its Explanation for
  Evolution of the Universe","New hypotheses are proposed that there are s-particles and v-particles which
are symmetric and mutually repulsive, there are S-space and V-space whose
essential difference is only that their expectation values of the Higgs fields
are different. In S-space the S-SU(5) symmetry is broken into S-SU(3)XU(1), and
V-SU(5) symmetry still holds. As a consequence, s-particles get their masses
determined by the SU(5) GUT and form the S-world, and v-particles are all
massless and form SU(5) colour-single states which are identified with dark
energy. The following results are obtained. There is no spacetime singularty,
and there is the highest temperature in the universe. The creating process of
one world is just the annihilating process of the other world in the highest
temperature. A formula which well describes the luminous distance and redshift
is obtained. The results of the Guth's inflationary scenario are obtained.
Decelerated expanding early stage and accelerated expanding now stage of the
universe are explained. New predictions are follows. Some huge cavities in
V-space are not empty, in which there is s-matter with larger density, and are
equivalent to huge concave lenses. The given tharacters of some huge cavities
are well explained. The gravitation between two galaxies distant enough will
lesser than that predicted by the conventional theory. A possible explanation
for the big redshift of quasi-stellar objects is presented. Huge redshifts of
quasars are mass redshifts. The universe is composed of infinite universal
islands. It is possible that there is a new annihilating mode of black holes
with their very huge masses, and there are very huge white holes which are
different from that predicted by conventional theory.",['Shi-Hao Chen'],2006-11-22T02:21:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0611283v5
"CAVE-AR: A VR Authoring System to Interactively Design, Simulate, and
  Debug Multi-user AR Experiences","Despite advances in augmented reality (AR), the process of creating
meaningful experiences with this technology is still extremely challenging. Due
to different tracking implementations and hardware constraints, developing AR
applications either requires low-level programming skills, or is done through
specific authoring tools that largely sacrifice the possibility of customizing
the AR experience. Existing development workflows also do not support
previewing or simulating the AR experience, requiring a lengthy process of
trial and error by which content creators deploy and physically test
applications in each iteration. To mitigate these limitations, we propose
CAVE-AR, a novel virtual reality system for authoring, simulating and debugging
custom AR experiences. Available both as a standalone or a plug-in tool,
CAVE-AR is based on the concept of representing in the same global reference
system both in AR content and tracking information, mixing geographical
information, architectural features, and sensor data to simulate the context of
an AR experience. Thanks to its novel abstraction of existing tracking
technologies, CAVE-AR operates independently of users' devices, and integrates
with existing programming tools to provide maximum flexibility. Our VR
application provides designers with ways to create and modify an AR
application, even while others are in the midst of using it. CAVE-AR further
allows the designer to track how users are behaving, preview what they are
currently seeing, and interact with them through several different channels. To
illustrate our proposed development workflow and demonstrate the advantages of
our authoring system, we introduce two CAVEAR use cases in which an augmented
reality application is created and tested. We compare the CAVE-AR workflow to
traditional development methods and demonstrate the importance of simulation
and live application debugging.","['Marco Cavallo', 'Angus G. Forbes']",2018-09-14T16:52:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05500v2

Dating Starburst and Post-Starburst Galaxies,"Stellar population models to predict the H Balmer and HeI lines in absorption

lines are constant. The comparison of these lines with the corresponding
nebular emission lines indicates that Hd and the higher-order terms of the

merging histories, and small-scale structures, which are both significantly at
variance with observations. Observers are polite, and often emphasise their

Paczy{\'n}ski-Wiita pseudo-Newtonian potential is used to mimic the
gravitational field of a Schwarzschild black hole. Both stellar
mass($14M_{\odot}$) and supermassive($10^8M_{\odot}$) black holes are
considered. The effects of bremsstrahlung and synchrotron cooling processes on
the flow dynamics are studied. Rankine-Hugoniot conditions are checked for
possible shock formation of solution branches of the topology. Stability of the

models combine bigram models whose predictions are conditioned on different
words. Both types of models are trained by Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation. We examine smoothing procedures
in which these models are interposed between different order n-grams. This is
found to significantly reduce the perplexity of unseen word combinations.","['Lawrence Saul', 'Fernando Pereira']",1997-06-09T20:38:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cmp-lg/9706007v1
A CLASSIFICATION OF QUANTUM HALL FLUIDS,"In this paper, the key ideas of characterizing universality classes of
dissipation-free (incompressible) quantum Hall fluids by mathematical objects

implications are discussed. Physically relevant subclasses of quantum Hall
lattices are defined and completely classified. The results are carefully
compared with experimental data and also with other theoretical schemes (the
hierarchy schemes). Several proposals for new experiments are made which could
help to settle interesting issues in the theory of the (fractional) quantum

Hurwitz Equivalence in Braid Group B_3,"In this paper we prove certain Hurwitz equivalence properties of $B_n$. In
particular we prove that for $n=3$ every two Artin's factorizations of $\Delta

j_k \in \{1,2 \}$) where $\{H_1, H_2 \}, \{F_1, F_2 \}$ are frames, are Hurwitz
equivalent. The proof provided here is geometric, based on a newly defined
frame type. The results will be applied to the classification of algebraic
surfaces up to deformation. It is already known that there exist surfaces that
are diffeomorphic to each other but are not deformations of each other (Manetti
example). We are constructing a new invariant based on Hurwitz equivalence

Conditions for entanglement in multipartite systems,"We introduce two entanglement conditions that take the form of inequalities

are not specified, and they are particularly useful in detecting multipartite
entanglement. We explore the range of utility of these conditions by
considering a number of examples of entangled states, and seeing under what

"The excluded minors for the class of matroids that are graphic or
  bicircular lift","Bicircular lift matroids are a class of matroids defined on the edge set of a
graph. For a given graph $G$, the circuits of its bicircular lift matroid
$L(G)$ are the edge sets of those subgraphs of $G$ that contain at least two
cycles, and are minimal with respect to this property. For each cycle $C$ of
$G$, since $L(G)/C$ is graphic and most graphic matroids are not bicircular
lift, the class of bicircular lift matroids is not minor-closed. In this paper,
we prove that the class of matroids that are graphic or bicircular lift has a
finite list of excluded minors.",['Rong Chen'],2016-09-10T13:19:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03049v1
On plant roots logical gates,"Theoretical constructs of logical gates implemented with plant roots are
morphological computing asynchronous devices. Values of Boolean variables are
represented by plant roots. A presence of a plant root at a given site
symbolises the logical {\sc True}, an absence the logical {\sc False}. Logical
functions are calculated via interaction between roots. Two types of
two-inputs-two-outputs gates are proposed: a gate $\langle x, y \rangle
\rightarrow \langle xy, x+y \rangle$ where root apexes are guided by gravity
and a gate $\langle x, y \rangle \rightarrow \langle \overline{x}y, x \rangle$
where root apexes are guided by humidity. We propose a design of binary
half-adder based on the gates.","['Andrew Adamatzky', 'Georgios Sirakoulis', 'Genaro J. Martinez', 'Frantisek Baluska', 'Stefano Mancuso']",2016-10-14T19:49:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04602v1
G-games with coalitions,"This paper models games where the strategies are nodes of a graph G (we
denote them as G-games) and in presence of coalition structures. The cases of
one-shot and repeated games are presented. In the latter situation, coalitions
are assumed to move from a strategy to another one under the constraint that
they are adjacent in the graph. We introduce novel concepts of pure and mixed
equilibria which are comparable with classical Nash and Berge equilibria. A
Folk Theorem for G-games of repeated type is presented. Moreover, equilibria
are proven to be described through suitably defined Markov Chains, hence
leading to a constrained Monte Carlo Markov Chain procedure.","['Roy Cerqueti', 'Emilio De Santis']",2018-03-05T15:45:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01738v1

cascades can also end in interacting conformal field theories, free field
theories, and meta-stable supersymmetry breaking. Higgsing effects are built
into the self-duality so that when the gauge groups are small enough,
supersymmetry is broken through the rank condition. Dynamical supersymmetry
restoration occurs far from the SUSY breaking vacuum resulting in a long lived
meta-stable vacuum. It is found that Coulomb branches are critical in the

Group network effects in price competition,"The partition of society into groups, polarization, and social networks are
part of most conversations today. How do they influence price competition? We
discuss Bertrand duopoly equilibria with demand subject to network effects.
Contrary to models where network effects depend on one aggregate variable
(demand for each choice), partitioning the dependence into groups creates a
wealth of pure price equilibria with profit for both price setters, even if
positive network effects are the dominant element of the game. If there is some
asymmetry in how groups interact, two groups are sufficient. If network effects
are based on undirected and unweighted graphs, at least five groups are
required but, without other differentiation, outcomes are symmetric.","['Renato Soeiro', 'Alberto Pinto']",2021-10-12T11:05:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05891v1

Rational expressions for Lagrange multipliers and feasible extensions of KKT

a hierarchy of rational optimization problems to solve rational generalized
Nash equilibrium problems. The existence and computation of feasible extensions
are studied. The Moment-SOS relaxations are applied to solve the rational

are skyrmion condensates and they are topologically equivalent. By gradually
tuning the stripe whose width goes from smaller than to larger than
skyrmion-skyrmion separation, the structure of a skyrmion condensate transforms
smoothly and continuously from various stripy phases, including helical states

Statistics of Fourier Modes in Non-Gaussian Fields,"Fourier methods are fundamental tools to analyze random fields. Statistical
structures of homogeneous Gaussian random fields are completely characterized
by the power spectrum. In non-Gaussian random fields, polyspectra, higher-order
counterparts of the power spectrum, are usually considered to characterize
statistical information contained in the fields. However, it is not trivial how
the Fourier modes are distributed in general non-Gaussian fields. In this
paper, distribution functions of Fourier modes are directly considered and
their explicit relations to the polyspectra are given. Under the condition that
any of the polyspectra does not diverge, the distribution function is expanded
by dimensionless combinations of polyspectra and a total volume in which the
Fourier transforms are performed. The expression up to second order is
generally given, and higher-order results are also derived in some cases. A
concept of N-point distribution function of Fourier modes are introduced and
explicitly calculated. Among them, the one-point distribution function is
completely given in a closed form up to arbitrary order. As an application,
statistics of Fourier phases are explored in detail. A number of aspects

"Scaling violations of quark and gluon jet fragmentation functions in
  e+e- annihilations at sqrt(s) = 91.2 and 183-209 GeV","Flavour inclusive, udsc and b fragmentation functions in unbiased jets, and
flavour inclusive, udsc, b and gluon fragmentation functions in biased jets are
measured in e+e- annihilations from data collected at centre-of-mass energies
of 91.2, and 183-209 GeV with the OPAL detector at LEP. The unbiased jets are
defined by hemispheres of inclusive hadronic events, while the biased jet
measurements are based on three-jet events selected with jet algorithms.
Several methods are employed to extract the fragmentation functions over a wide
range of scales. Possible biases are studied in the results are obtained. The
fragmentation functions are compared to results from lower energy e+e-
experiments and with earlier LEP measurements and are found to be consistent.
Scaling violations are observed and are found to be stronger for the
fragmentation functions of gluon jets than for those of quarks. The measured
fragmentation functions are compared to three recent theoretical
next-to-leading order calculations and to the predictions of three Monte Carlo
event generators. While the Monte Carlo models are in good agreement with the
data, the theoretical predictions fail to describe the full set of results, in
particular the b and gluon jet measurements.","['The OPAL collaboration', 'G. Abbiendi']",2004-04-21T14:11:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0404026v1
