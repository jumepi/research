"Lysine-Cysteine-Serine-Tryptophan Inserted into the DNA-Binding Domain
  of Human Mineralocorticoid Receptor Increases Transcriptional Activation by
  Aldosterone","Due to alternative splicing in an ancestral DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the
mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), humans contain two almost identical MR
transcripts with either 984 amino acids (MR-984) or 988 amino acids (MR-988),
in which their DBDs differ by only four amino acids, Lys,Cys,Ser,Trp (KCSW).
Human MRs also contain mutations at two sites, codons 180 and 241, in the amino
terminal domain (NTD). Together, there are five distinct full-length human MR
genes in GenBank. Human MR-984, which was cloned in 1987, has been extensively
studied. Human MR-988, cloned in 1995, contains KCSW in its DBD. Neither this
human MR-988 nor the other human MR-988 genes have been studied for their
response to aldosterone and other corticosteroids. Here, we report that
transcriptional activation of human MR-988 by aldosterone is increased by about
50% compared to activation of human MR-984 in HEK293 cells transfected with the
TAT3 promoter, while the half-maximal response (EC50) is similar for
aldosterone activation of MR-984 and MR-988. Transcriptional activation of
human MR also depends on the amino acids at codons 180 and 241. Interestingly,
in HEK293 cells transfected with the MMTV promoter, transcriptional activation
by aldosterone of human MR-988 is similar to activation of human MR-984,
indicating that the promoter has a role in the regulation of the response of
human MR-988 to aldosterone. The physiological responses to aldosterone and
other corticosteroids in humans with MR genes containing KCSW and with
differences at codons 180 and 241 in the NTD warrant investigation.","['Yoshinao Katsu', 'Jiawen Zhang', 'Michael E. Baker']",2024-05-16T20:30:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10432v1
"MR-Scout: Automated Synthesis of Metamorphic Relations from Existing
  Test Cases","Metamorphic Testing (MT) alleviates the oracle problem by defining oracles
based on metamorphic relations (MRs), that govern multiple related inputs and
their outputs. However, designing MRs is challenging, as it requires
domain-specific knowledge. This hinders the widespread adoption of MT. We
observe that developer-written test cases can embed domain knowledge that
encodes MRs. Such encoded MRs could be synthesized for testing not only their
original programs but also other programs that share similar functionalities.
  In this paper, we propose MR-Scout to automatically synthesize MRs from test
cases in open-source software (OSS) projects. MR-Scout first discovers
MR-encoded test cases (MTCs), and then synthesizes the encoded MRs into
parameterized methods (called codified MRs), and filters out MRs that
demonstrate poor quality for new test case generation. MR-Scout discovered over
11,000 MTCs from 701 OSS projects. Experimental results show that over 97% of
codified MRs are of high quality for automated test case generation,
demonstrating the practical applicability of MR-Scout. Furthermore,
codified-MRs-based tests effectively enhance the test adequacy of programs with
developer-written tests, leading to 13.52% and 9.42% increases in line coverage
and mutation score, respectively. Our qualitative study shows that 55.76% to
76.92% of codified MRs are easily comprehensible for developers.","['Congying Xu', 'Valerio Terragni', 'Hengcheng Zhu', 'Jiarong Wu', 'Shing-Chi Cheung']",2023-04-15T12:53:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07548v3
"Novel Evolution of the Mineralocorticoid Receptor in Humans compared to
  Chimpanzees, Gorillas and Orangutans","Five distinct full-length mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) genes have been
identified in humans. These human MRs can be distinguished by the presence or
absence of an in-frame insertion of 12 base pairs coding for Lys, Cys, Ser, Trp
(KCSW) in their DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the presence of two amino acid
mutations in their amino terminal domain (NTD). Two human MRs with the KCSW
insertion (MR-KCSW) and three human MRs without KCSW in the DBD have been
identified. The three human MRs without KCSW contain either (Ile-180, Ala-241)
or (Val-180, Val-241) or (Ile-180, Val-241) in their NTD. The two human MRs
with KCSW contain either (Val-180, Val-241) or (Ile-180, Val-241) in their NTD.
Human MR-KCSW with (Ile-180, Ala-241) has not been cloned. In contrast,
chimpanzees contain two MRs with KCSW and two MRs without KCSW in their DBD and
both contain only Ile180, Val-241 in their NTDs. Each pair of chimpanzee MRs
differ at another amino acid in the NTD. A chimpanzee MR with either Val-180,
Val-241 or Ile-180, Ala-241 in the NTD has not been cloned. Gorillas and
orangutans each contain one MR with KCSW in the DBD and one MR without KCSW.
Both gorilla and orangutan MRs contain I-180, Val-241 in their NTD. Neither
Val-180, Val-241 nor Ile-180, Ala-241 are found in the NTD in either a gorilla
MR or an orangutan MR. These data suggest that human MRs with Val-180, Val-241
or Ile-180, Ala-241 in the NTD evolved after humans and chimpanzees diverged
from their common ancestor. These unique human MRs may have had a role in the
divergent evolution of humans from chimpanzees. Studies are underway to
characterize transcriptional activation of the five human MRs by aldosterone,
cortisol, and other corticosteroids for comparison with each other to elucidate
the roles of these MRs in human physiology.","['Yoshinao Katsu', 'Jiawen Zhang', 'Michael E. Baker']",2023-12-08T22:33:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05396v1
Towards a Complete Metamorphic Testing Pipeline,"Metamorphic Testing (MT) addresses the test oracle problem by examining the
relationships between input-output pairs in consecutive executions of the
System Under Test (SUT). These relations, known as Metamorphic Relations (MRs),
specify the expected output changes resulting from specific input changes.
However, achieving full automation in generating, selecting, and understanding
MR violations poses challenges. Our research aims to develop methods and tools
that assist testers in generating MRs, defining constraints, and providing
explainability for MR outcomes. In the MR generation phase, we explore
automated techniques that utilise a domain-specific language to generate and
describe MRs. The MR constraint definition focuses on capturing the nuances of
MR applicability by defining constraints. These constraints help identify the
specific conditions under which MRs are expected to hold. The evaluation and
validation involve conducting empirical studies to assess the effectiveness of
the developed methods and validate their applicability in real-world regression
testing scenarios. Through this research, we aim to advance the automation of
MR generation, enhance the understanding of MR violations, and facilitate their
effective application in regression testing.","['Alejandra Duque-Torres', 'Dietmar Pfahl']",2023-09-30T10:49:22Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00338v1
"Magnetoresistance of 2D and 3D Electron Gas in LaAlO3/SrTiO3
  Heterostructures: Influence of Magnetic Ordering, Interface Scattering and
  Dimensionality","Magnetoresistance (MR) anisotropy in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) interfaces is
compared between samples prepared in high oxygen partial pressure (PO2) of 10-4
mbar exhibiting quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) electron gas and low PO2 of
10-6 mbar exhibiting 3D conductivity. While MR of an order of magnitude larger
was observed in low PO2 samples compared to those of high PO2 samples, large MR
anisotropies were observed in both cases. The MR with the out-of-plane field is
always larger compared to the MR with in-plane field suggesting lower
dissipation of electrons from interface versus defect scattering. The quasi-2D
interfaces show a negative MR at low temperatures while the 3D interfaces show
positive MR for all temperatures. Furthermore, the angle relationship of MR
anisotropy for these two different cases and temperature dependence of in-plane
MR are also presented. Our study demonstrates that MR can be used to
distinguish the dimensionality of the charge transport and various (defect,
magnetic center, and interface boundary) scattering processes in this system.","['X. Wang', 'W. M Lü', 'A. Annadi', 'Z. Q. Liu', 'S. Dhar', 'T. Venkatesan', 'Ariando']",2011-10-24T17:49:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5290v1
"Transcriptional Activation of Elephant Shark Mineralocorticoid Receptor
  by Corticosteroids, Progesterone and Spironolactone","We report the analysis of activation by corticosteroids and progesterone of
full-length mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) from elephant shark, a
cartilaginous fish belonging to the oldest group of jawed vertebrates. Based on
their measured activities, aldosterone, cortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone,
corticosterone, 11-deoxcortisol, progesterone and 19-norprogesterone are
potential physiological mineralocorticoids. However, aldosterone, the
physiological mineralocorticoid in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates, is
not found in cartilaginous or ray-finned fishes. Because progesterone is a
precursor for corticosteroids that activate elephant shark MR, we propose that
progesterone was an ancestral ligand for elephant shark MR. Although
progesterone activates ray-finned fish MRs, progesterone does not activate
human, amphibian or alligator MRs, suggesting that during the transition to
terrestrial vertebrates, progesterone lost the ability to activate the MR.
Comparison of RNA-sequence analysis of elephant shark MR with that of human MR
suggests that MR expression in the human brain, heart, ovary, testis and other
non-epithelial tissues evolved in cartilaginous fishes. Together, these data
suggest that progesterone-activated MR may have unappreciated functions in
elephant shark ovary and testis.","['Yoshinao Katsu', 'Satomi Kohno', 'Kaori Oka', 'Xiaozhi Lin', 'Sumika Otake', 'Nisha E. Pillai', 'Wataru Takagi', 'Susumu Hyodo', 'Byrappa Venkatesh', 'Michael E. Baker']",2018-08-22T19:43:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07539v1
Practical Repetition-Aware Grammar Compression,"The goal of grammar compression is to construct a small sized context free
grammar which uniquely generates the input text data. Among grammar compression
methods, RePair is known for its good practical compression performance.
MR-RePair was recently proposed as an improvement to RePair for constructing
small-sized context free grammar for repetitive text data. However, a compact
encoding scheme has not been discussed for MR-RePair. We propose a practical
encoding method for MR-RePair and show its effectiveness through comparative
experiments. Moreover, we extend MR-RePair to run-length context free grammar
and design a novel variant for it called RL-MR-RePair. We experimentally
demonstrate that a compression scheme consisting of RL-MR-RePair and the
proposed encoding method show good performance on real repetitive datasets.",['Isamu Furuya'],2019-10-29T18:58:48Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13479v1
"Motion correction for PET using subspace-based real-time MR imaging in
  simultaneous PET/MR","Image quality of PET reconstructions is degraded by subject motion occurring
during the acquisition. MR-based motion correction approaches have been studied
for PET/MR scanners and have been successful at capturing regular motion
patterns, when used in conjunction with surrogate signals (e.g. navigators) to
detect motion. However, handling irregular respiratory motion and bulk motion
remains challenging. In this work, we propose an MR-based motion correction
method relying on subspace-based real-time MR imaging to estimate motion fields
used to correct PET reconstructions. We take advantage of the low-rank
characteristics of dynamic MR images to reconstruct high-resolution MR images
at high frame rates from highly undersampled k-space data. Reconstructed
dynamic MR images are used to determine motion phases for PET reconstruction
and estimate phase-to-phase nonrigid motion fields able to capture complex
motion patterns such as irregular respiratory and bulk motion. MR-derived
binning and motion fields are used for PET reconstruction to generate
motion-corrected PET images. The proposed method was evaluated on in vivo data
with irregular motion patterns. MR reconstructions accurately captured motion,
outperforming state-of-the-art dynamic MR reconstruction techniques. Evaluation
of PET reconstructions demonstrated the benefits of the proposed method over
standard methods in terms of motion artifact reduction. The proposed method can
improve the image quality of motion-corrected PET reconstructions in clinical
applications.","['Thibault Marin', 'Yanis Djebra', 'Paul K. Han', 'Yanis Chemli', 'Isabelle Bloch', 'Georges El Fakhri', 'Jinsong Ouyang', 'Yoann Petibon', 'Chao Ma']",2020-08-27T20:04:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12359v2
"Magneto-transport Effects in Topological Insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$
  Nanoribbons","Magneto-resistance (MR) of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ nanoribbons is studied over a broad
range of temperature ($T$=300K-2K) and under various magnetic field ($B$)
orientations. The MR is strongly anisotropic with the perpendicular MR much
larger than the longitudinal and transverse MRs. The perpendicular MR exhibits
quadratic $B$-dependence in low fields and becomes linear at high $B$. However,
when $T$ increases, the perpendicular MR becomes linear over the whole magnetic
field range (0-9T) up to room temperature. This unusual linear MR is discussed
in the context of the linear quantum MR of the topological surface-states. We
also observe the boundary-scattering effect in MR at low temperatures, which
indicates that the out-of-plane Fermi momentum is much smaller the in-plane
Fermi momentum, excluding the simple three-dimensional Fermi surface picture.","['Hao Tang', 'Dong Liang', 'Richard L. J. Qiu', 'Xuan P. A. Gao']",2010-03-31T17:15:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.6099v4
Deep MR to CT Synthesis using Unpaired Data,"MR-only radiotherapy treatment planning requires accurate MR-to-CT synthesis.
Current deep learning methods for MR-to-CT synthesis depend on pairwise aligned
MR and CT training images of the same patient. However, misalignment between
paired images could lead to errors in synthesized CT images. To overcome this,
we propose to train a generative adversarial network (GAN) with unpaired MR and
CT images. A GAN consisting of two synthesis convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and two discriminator CNNs was trained with cycle consistency to
transform 2D brain MR image slices into 2D brain CT image slices and vice
versa. Brain MR and CT images of 24 patients were analyzed. A quantitative
evaluation showed that the model was able to synthesize CT images that closely
approximate reference CT images, and was able to outperform a GAN model trained
with paired MR and CT images.","['Jelmer M. Wolterink', 'Anna M. Dinkla', 'Mark H. F. Savenije', 'Peter R. Seevinck', 'Cornelis A. T. van den Berg', 'Ivana Isgum']",2017-08-03T14:18:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01155v1
Metamorphic Relation Prioritization for Effective Regression Testing,"Metamorphic testing (MT) is widely used for testing programs that face the
oracle problem. It uses a set of metamorphic relations (MRs), which are
relations among multiple inputs and their corresponding outputs to determine
whether the program under test is faulty. Typically, MRs vary in their ability
to detect faults in the program under test, and some MRs tend to detect the
same set of faults. In this paper, we propose approaches to prioritize MRs to
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of MT for regression testing. We
present two MR prioritization approaches: (1) fault-based and (2)
coverage-based. To evaluate these MR prioritization approaches, we conduct
experiments on three complex open-source software systems. Our results show
that the MR prioritization approaches developed by us significantly outperform
the current practice of executing the source and follow-up test cases of the
MRs in an ad-hoc manner in terms of fault detection effectiveness. Further,
fault-based MR prioritization leads to reducing the number of source and
follow-up test cases that needs to be executed as well as reducing the average
time taken to detect a fault, which would result in saving time and cost during
the testing process.","['Madhusudan Srinivasan', 'Upulee Kanewala']",2021-09-20T19:06:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09798v1
"3D cine-magnetic resonance imaging using spatial and temporal implicit
  neural representation learning (STINR-MR)","The reconstruction of 3D cine-MRI is challenged by highly undersampled
k-space data in each cine frame, due to the slow speed of MR signal
acquisition. We proposed a machine learning-based framework, spatial and
temporal implicit neural representation learning (STINR-MR), for accurate 3D
cine-MRI reconstruction from highly undersampled data. STINR-MR used a joint
reconstruction and deformable registration approach to address the ill-posed
spatiotemporal reconstruction problem, by solving a reference-frame 3D MR image
and a corresponding motion model which deforms the reference frame to each cine
frame. The reference-frame image was reconstructed as a spatial implicit neural
representation (INR) network, which learns the mapping from input 3D spatial
coordinates to corresponding MR values. The dynamic motion model was
constructed via a temporal INR, as well as basis deformation vector
fields(DVFs) extracted from prior/onboard 4D-MRIs. The learned INR encodes
input time points and outputs corresponding weighting factors to combine the
basis DVFs into time-resolved motion fields. STINR-MR was evaluated using MR
data simulated from the 4D extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) digital phantom and MR
data acquired clinically from a healthy human subject. Its reconstruction
accuracy was also compared with that of the model-based non-rigid motion
estimation method (MR-MOTUS). STINR-MR can reconstruct 3D cine-MR images with
high temporal (<100 ms) and spatial (3 mm) resolutions to accurately capture
different irregular motion patterns. Compared with MR-MOTUS, STINR-MR
consistently reconstructed images with better quality, fewer artifacts, and
achieved superior tumor localization accuracy. STINR-MR provides a lightweight
and efficient framework for accurate 3D cine-MRI reconstruction, and does not
require external data for pre-training to avoid generalizability issues
encountered in deep learning methods.","['Hua-Chieh Shao', 'Tielige Mengke', 'Jie Deng', 'You Zhang']",2023-08-18T18:48:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09771v1
"Short echo time relaxation-enhanced MR spectroscopy reveals broad
  downfield resonances","Purpose: Most MR spectroscopy (MRS) pulse sequences rely on broadband
excitation with water saturation and typically focus on upfield signals. By
contrast, the downfield spectrum, which contains many potentially useful
resonances, is typically not targeted because conventional water-suppressed
techniques indirectly saturate the labile protons through exchange.
Relaxation-enhanced MRS (RE-MRS) uses frequency-selective excitation while
actively avoiding bulk water perturbation, thereby enabling high-quality
downfield spectroscopy. However, RE-MRS typically requires very long (typically
>40 ms) echo times (TEs) due to its localization module, which inevitably
decreases sensitivity and filters shorter T2 components. Here, we overcome this
limitation by combining RE-MRS and image selected in vivo spectroscopy (ISIS)
localization, abbreviated iRE-MRS, which in turn allows very short TEs (5 ms
using our hardware).
  Methods: Experiments were performed in vitro for validation as well as and in
in vivo rat brains at 9.4T.
  Results: The new iRE-MRS methodology was validated in phantoms where good
performance was noted. When the downfield spectrum was investigated at short
TEs in in vivo rat brains, iRE-MRS provided very high sensitivity; the ensuing
downfield spectra encompassed numerous broad peaks, as well as a broad
baseline. All downfield spectral peaks were highly attenuated by increasing TEs
as well as by applying water saturation, although to different extent. The
signal ratios also varied between TEs, suggesting that exchange rates are
different among the downfield signals.
  Conclusions: Short-TE iRE 1H downfield MRS opens new directions in the
investigation of in vivo downfield metabolites and their role on healthy and
disease processes.","['Sónia I. Gonçalves', 'Clémence Ligneul', 'Noam Shemesh']",2019-05-22T14:15:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09158v1
"Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Image Synthesis with Contrast-Aware
  Generative Adversarial Networks","A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exam typically consists of the acquisition
of multiple MR pulse sequences, which are required for a reliable diagnosis.
Each sequence can be parameterized through multiple acquisition parameters
affecting MR image contrast, signal-to-noise ratio, resolution, or scan time.
With the rise of generative deep learning models, approaches for the synthesis
of MR images are developed to either synthesize additional MR contrasts,
generate synthetic data, or augment existing data for AI training. However,
current generative approaches for the synthesis of MR images are only trained
on images with a specific set of acquisition parameter values, limiting the
clinical value of these methods as various sets of acquisition parameter
settings are used in clinical practice. Therefore, we trained a generative
adversarial network (GAN) to generate synthetic MR knee images conditioned on
various acquisition parameters (repetition time, echo time, image orientation).
This approach enables us to synthesize MR images with adjustable image
contrast. In a visual Turing test, two experts mislabeled 40.5% of real and
synthetic MR images, demonstrating that the image quality of the generated
synthetic and real MR images is comparable. This work can support radiologists
and technologists during the parameterization of MR sequences by previewing the
yielded MR contrast, can serve as a valuable tool for radiology training, and
can be used for customized data generation to support AI training.","['Jonas Denck', 'Jens Guehring', 'Andreas Maier', 'Eva Rothgang']",2021-02-17T11:39:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09386v2
"Two Wrongs Can Make a Right: A Transfer Learning Approach for Chemical
  Discovery with Chemical Accuracy","Appropriately identifying and treating molecules and materials with
significant multi-reference (MR) character is crucial for achieving high data
fidelity in virtual high throughput screening (VHTS). Nevertheless, most VHTS
is carried out with approximate density functional theory (DFT) using a single
functional. Despite development of numerous MR diagnostics, the extent to which
a single value of such a diagnostic indicates MR effect on chemical property
prediction is not well established. We evaluate MR diagnostics of over 10,000
transition metal complexes (TMCs) and compare to those in organic molecules. We
reveal that only some MR diagnostics are transferable across these materials
spaces. By studying the influence of MR character on chemical properties (i.e.,
MR effect) that involves multiple potential energy surfaces (i.e., adiabatic
spin splitting, $\Delta E_\mathrm{H-L}$, and ionization potential, IP), we
observe that cancellation in MR effect outweighs accumulation. Differences in
MR character are more important than the total degree of MR character in
predicting MR effect in property prediction. Motivated by this observation, we
build transfer learning models to directly predict CCSD(T)-level adiabatic
$\Delta E_\mathrm{H-L}$ and IP from lower levels of theory. By combining these
models with uncertainty quantification and multi-level modeling, we introduce a
multi-pronged strategy that accelerates data acquisition by at least a factor
of three while achieving chemical accuracy (i.e., 1 kcal/mol) for robust VHTS.","['Chenru Duan', 'Daniel B. K. Chu', 'Aditya Nandy', 'Heather J. Kulik']",2022-01-11T23:45:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04243v1
"Domain Adaptation of Automated Treatment Planning from Computed

addresses the iterative and time-consuming nature of conventional inverse
planning. Given the rising importance of Magnetic resonance (MR) only treatment
planning workflows, we sought to determine if an ML based treatment planning
model, trained on computed tomography (CT) imaging, could be applied to MR
through domain adaptation. Methods: In this study, MR and CT imaging was
collected from 55 prostate cancer patients treated on an MR linear accelerator.
ML based plans were generated for each patient on both CT and MR imaging using
a commercially available model in RayStation 8B. The dose distributions and
acceptance rates of MR and CT based plans were compared using institutional
dose-volume evaluation criteria. The dosimetric differences between MR and CT
plans were further decomposed into setup, cohort, and imaging domain
components. Results: MR plans were highly acceptable, meeting 93.1% of all
evaluation criteria compared to 96.3% of CT plans, with dose equivalence for
all evaluation criteria except for the bladder wall, penile bulb, small and
large bowel, and one rectum wall criteria (p<0.05). Changing the input imaging
modality (domain component) only accounted for about half of the dosimetric
differences observed between MR and CT plans. Anatomical differences between
the ML training set and the MR linac cohort (cohort component) were also a
significant contributor. Significance: We were able to create highly acceptable
MR based treatment plans using a CT-trained ML model for treatment planning,
although clinically significant dose deviations from the CT based plans were
observed.","['Aly Khalifa', 'Jeff Winter', 'Inmaculada Navarro', 'Chris McIntosh', 'Thomas G. Purdie']",2022-03-07T18:18:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03576v1
"Core-Excited States and X-Ray Absorption Spectra From Multireference
  Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction Theory","We report the development and benchmark of multireference algebraic
diagrammatic construction theory (MR-ADC) for the simulations of core-excited
states and X-ray absorption spectra (XAS). Our work features an implementation
that incorporates core-valence separation into the strict and extended
second-order MR-ADC approximations (MR-ADC(2) and MR-ADC(2)-X), providing an
efficient access to high-energy excited states without including inner-shell
orbitals in the active space. Benchmark results on a set of small molecules
indicate that at equilibrium geometries the accuracy of MR-ADC is similar to
that of single-reference ADC theory when static correlation effects are not
important. In this case, MR-ADC(2)-X performs similarly to single- and
multireference coupled cluster methods in reproducing the experimental XAS peak
spacings. We demonstrate the potential of MR-ADC for chemical systems with
multiconfigurational electronic structure by calculating the K-edge XAS
spectrum of the ozone molecule with a multireference character in its ground
electronic state and the dissociation curve of core-excited molecular nitrogen.
For ozone, the MR-ADC results agree well with the data from experimental and
previous multireference studies of ozone XAS, in contrast to the results of
single-reference methods, which underestimate relative peak energies and
intensities. The MR-ADC methods also predict the correct shape of core-excited
nitrogen potential energy curve, in a good agreement with accurate calculations
using driven similarity renormalization group approaches. These findings
suggest that MR-ADC(2) and MR-ADC(2)-X are promising methods for the XAS
simulations of multireference systems and pave the way for their efficient
computer implementation and applications.","['Ilia M. Mazin', 'Alexander Yu. Sokolov']",2023-05-05T20:31:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03836v2

can be efficiently and reliably applied to systems, which exhibit strong
electron correlation in the ground or excited electronic states. In contrast to
conventional multi-reference perturbation theories, MR-ADC describes electronic

"N-terminal domain Increases Activation of Elephant Shark Glucocorticoid

"On the Rates of Steady, Quasi-steady and Impulsive Magnetic Reconnection","Magnetic reconnection (MR) is considered as a major source of particle
energization in astrophysical plasma. In the past, analysis of MR often assumes
the magnetostatic condition, i.e. $\partial_t = 0$. We show that under the
Sweet-Parker-Petschek framework, steady state is an over-constraint and is not
achievable. On the other hand, the quasi-steady state defined as $\partial_t
\mathbf{E} = 0$ but $\partial_t \mathbf{B} \neq 0$ or equivalently
$\partial_t\mathbf{j}\neq 0$ better describes the asymptotic behaviour of MR
without turbulence. The upper limit of MR rate for quasi-steady MR is found to
be $\sim 1/3\sqrt{3} \sim 0.19$. The limit does not apply to impulsive or
turbulent MR of which $\partial_t\mathbf{B} \neq 0$ and $\partial_t\mathbf{E}
\neq 0$. In impulsive MR the rate can be higher or lower than 0.19 depending on
the state of the turbulence. Our results may explain the apparent discrepancy
in observations of solar flare MR rates. The analysis is independent of mass
ratio and thus the results are applicable to pair plasma.",['H. Che'],2018-02-21T19:01:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07748v2
"Longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistance of SrTiO$_3$ with a single
  closed Fermi surface","The magnetoresistance (MR) of SrTiO$_3$ is theoretically investigated based
on the Boltzmann equation by considering its detailed band structure. The
formula for MR proposed by Mackey and Sybert is extended to be applicable to a
system with an arbitrarily shaped Fermi surface. It is shown that the angular
dependence of the diagonal component of the mass tensor causes transverse MR,
whereas that of the off-diagonal component causes longitudinal MR with only a
single closed Fermi surface, which overturns the textbook understanding of MR.
The calculated MR (300% at 10 T) quantitatively agrees with the experimental
results for SrTiO$_3$ including the behavior of the linear MR. The negative
Gaussian curvature of the Fermi surface of SrTiO$_3$ and its resulting negative
longitudinal and transverse MR are also discussed.","['Yudai Awashima', 'Yuki Fuseya']",2019-10-08T05:47:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03223v1
Large longitudinal magnetoresistance of multivalley systems,"The longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR) is assumed to be hardly realized as
the Lorentz force does not work on electrons when the magnetic field is
parallel to the current. However, in some cases, longitudinal MR becomes large,
which exceeds the transverse MR. To solve this problem, we have investigated
the longitudinal MR considering multivalley contributions based on the
classical MR theory. We have showed that the large longitudinal MR is caused by
off-diagonal components of a mobility tensor. Our theoretical results agree
with the experiments of large longitudinal MR in IV-VI semiconductors,
especially in PbTe, for a wide range of temperatures, except for linear MR at
low temperatures.","['Yuki Mitani', 'Yuki Fuseya']",2020-05-31T12:03:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00498v3
"Learning Bloch Simulations for MR Fingerprinting by Invertible Neural
  Networks","Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) enables fast and multiparametric MR
imaging. Despite fast acquisition, the state-of-the-art reconstruction of MRF
based on dictionary matching is slow and lacks scalability. To overcome these
limitations, neural network (NN) approaches estimating MR parameters from
fingerprints have been proposed recently. Here, we revisit NN-based MRF
reconstruction to jointly learn the forward process from MR parameters to
fingerprints and the backward process from fingerprints to MR parameters by
leveraging invertible neural networks (INNs). As a proof-of-concept, we perform
various experiments showing the benefit of learning the forward process, i.e.,
the Bloch simulations, for improved MR parameter estimation. The benefit
especially accentuates when MR parameter estimation is difficult due to MR
physical restrictions. Therefore, INNs might be a feasible alternative to the
current solely backward-based NNs for MRF reconstruction.","['Fabian Balsiger', 'Alain Jungo', 'Olivier Scheidegger', 'Benjamin Marty', 'Mauricio Reyes']",2020-08-10T14:09:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04139v2
"Contribution of Magnetic Reconnection Events to Energy Dissipation in
  Magnetosheath Turbulence","By analyzing the magnetosheath measurements from MMS, we obtain the
statistical results for the contribution of magnetic reconnection (MR) events
at electron scales to the energy dissipation of coherent structures. The
Partial Variance of Increments (PVI) method is employed to find coherent
structures in the magnetic field data. The current sheet structures with
reversal of magnetic field components are further selected. We consider the
following criteria to identify the MR events, such as current sheet with
magnetic field reversal, significant energy dissipation, and evident electron
outflow velocity. Statistically, for most MR events, their PVI values are
larger than that of other types of coherent structures, and their energy
dissipations are also stronger than that of others. However, due to the
relatively small proportion of MR events, their contribution to coherent
structures' energy dissipation is relatively trivial. If taken into account the
dissipation of non-coherent structures, the MR's contribution to energy
dissipation would be less. Hence, we suggest that MR events, though have strong
dissipation locally, are not the major contributor to the energy dissipation in
the magnetosheath. After analyzing the features of non-MR current sheets, we
propose that non-MR current sheets are mainly coherent structures inherent to
kinetic Alfv\'en fluctuations.","['Chuanpeng Hou', 'Jiansen He', 'Xingyu Zhu', 'Ying Wang']",2020-10-28T02:27:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03333v1
"Realistic Volume Rendering with Environment-Synced Illumination in Mixed
  Reality","Interactive volume visualization using a mixed reality (MR) system helps
provide users with an intuitive spatial perception of volumetric data. Due to
sophisticated requirements of user interaction and vision when using MR
head-mounted display (HMD) devices, the conflict between the realisticness and
efficiency of direct volume rendering (DVR) is yet to be resolved. In this
paper, a new MR visualization framework that supports interactive realistic DVR
is proposed. An efficient illumination estimation method is used to identify
the high dynamic range (HDR) environment illumination captured using a panorama
camera. To improve the visual quality of Monte Carlo-based DVR, a new
spatio-temporal denoising algorithm is designed. Based on a reprojection
strategy, it makes full use of temporal coherence between adjacent frames and
spatial coherence between the two screens of an HMD to optimize MR rendering
quality. Several MR development modules are also developed for related devices
to efficiently and stably display the DVR results in an MR HMD. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework can better support immersive and

Towards Predicting Collective Performance in Multi-Robot Teams,"The increased deployment of multi-robot systems (MRS) in various fields has
led to the need for analysis of system-level performance. However, creating
consistent metrics for MRS is challenging due to the wide range of system and
environmental factors, such as team size and environment size. This paper
presents a new analytical framework for MRS based on dimensionless variable
analysis, a mathematical technique typically used to simplify complex physical
systems. This approach effectively condenses the complex parameters influencing
MRS performance into a manageable set of dimensionless variables. We form
dimensionless variables which encapsulate key parameters of the robot team and
task. Then we use these dimensionless variables to fit a parametric model of
team performance. Our model successfully identifies critical performance
determinants and their interdependencies, providing insight for MRS design and
optimization. The application of dimensionless variable analysis to MRS offers
a promising method for MRS analysis that effectively reduces complexity,
enhances comprehension of system behaviors, and informs the design and
management of future MRS deployments.","['Pujie Xin', 'Zhanteng Xie', 'Philip Dames']",2024-05-02T22:55:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01771v1

magnetoresistance (MR) in the PrFeAsO, one of the parent compound of pnictide
superconductors. Below the spin density wave transition, MR is large, positive
and increases with decreasing temperature. At low temperatures, MR increases
linearly with $B$ up to 14 T. For $T$$\geq$40 K, MR vs $B$ curve develops a
weak curvature in the low-field region which indicates a crossover from $B$
linear to $B^2$ dependence as $B$$\rightarrow$0. The $B$ linear MR originates
from the Dirac cone states and has been explained by the quantum mechanical
model proposed by Abrikosov.","['D. Bhoi', 'P. Mandal', 'P. Choudhury', 'S. Pandya', 'V. Ganesan']",2011-04-12T11:53:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2177v1

Progesterone: An Enigmatic Ligand for the Mineralocorticoid Receptor,"The progesterone receptor (PR) mediates progesterone regulation of female
reproductive physiology, as well as gene transcription in non-reproductive
tissues, such as brain, bone, lung and vasculature, in both women and men. An
unusual property of progesterone is its high affinity for the mineralocorticoid
receptor (MR), which regulates electrolyte transport in the kidney in humans
and other terrestrial vertebrates. In humans, rats, alligators and frogs,
progesterone antagonizes activation of the MR by aldosterone, the physiological
mineralocorticoid in terrestrial vertebrates. In contrast, in elephant shark,
ray-finned fishes and chickens, progesterone activates the MR. Interestingly,
cartilaginous fishes and ray-finned fishes do not synthesize aldosterone,
raising the question of which steroid(s) activate the MR in cartilaginous
fishes and ray-finned fishes. The simpler synthesis of progesterone, compared
to cortisol and other corticosteroids, makes progesterone a candidate
physiological activator of the MR in elephant sharks and ray-finned fishes.
Elephant shark and ray-finned fish MRs are expressed in diverse tissues,
including heart, brain and lung, as well as, ovary and testis, two reproductive
tissues that are targets for progesterone, which together suggests a
multi-faceted physiological role for progesterone activation of the MR in
elephant shark and ray-finned fish. The functional consequences of progesterone
as an antagonist of some terrestrial vertebrate MRs and as an agonist of fish
and chicken MRs are not fully understood. Indeed, little is known of
physiological activities of progesterone via any vertebrate MR.","['Michael E. Baker', 'Yoshinao Katsu']",2020-01-22T00:08:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07822v1
"Multireference Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction Theory for Excited
  States: Extended Second-Order Implementation and Benchmark","We present an implementation and benchmark of new approximations in
multireference algebraic diagrammatic construction theory for simulations of
neutral electronic excitations and UV/Vis spectra of strongly correlated
molecular systems (MR-ADC). Following our work on the first-order MR-ADC
approximation [J. Chem. Phys. 2018, 149, 204113], we report the strict and
extended second-order MR-ADC methods (MR-ADC(2) and MR-ADC(2)-X) that combine
the description of static and dynamic electron correlation in the ground and
excited electronic states without relying on state-averaged reference
wavefunctions. We present an extensive benchmark of the new MR-ADC methods for
excited states in several small molecules, including the carbon dimer,
ethylene, and butadiene. Our results demonstrate that for weakly-correlated
electronic states the MR-ADC(2) and MR-ADC(2)-X methods outperform the
third-order single-reference ADC approximation and are competitive with the
results from equation-of-motion coupled cluster theory. For states with
multireference character, the performance of the MR-ADC methods is similar to
that of an N-electron valence perturbation theory. In contrast to conventional
multireference perturbation theories, the MR-ADC methods have a number of
attractive features, such as a straightforward and efficient calculation of
excited-state properties and a direct access to excitations outside of the

Bridging the gap between paired and unpaired medical image translation,"Medical image translation has the potential to reduce the imaging workload,
by removing the need to capture some sequences, and to reduce the annotation
burden for developing machine learning methods. GANs have been used
successfully to translate images from one domain to another, such as MR to CT.
At present, paired data (registered MR and CT images) or extra supervision
(e.g. segmentation masks) is needed to learn good translation models.
Registering multiple modalities or annotating structures within each of them is
a tedious and laborious task. Thus, there is a need to develop improved
translation methods for unpaired data. Here, we introduce modified pix2pix
models for tasks CT$\rightarrow$MR and MR$\rightarrow$CT, trained with unpaired
CT and MR data, and MRCAT pairs generated from the MR scans. The proposed
modifications utilize the paired MR and MRCAT images to ensure good alignment
between input and translated images, and unpaired CT images ensure the
MR$\rightarrow$CT model produces realistic-looking CT and CT$\rightarrow$MR
model works well with real CT as input. The proposed pix2pix variants
outperform baseline pix2pix, pix2pixHD and CycleGAN in terms of FID and KID,
and generate more realistic looking CT and MR translations.","['Pauliina Paavilainen', 'Saad Ullah Akram', 'Juho Kannala']",2021-10-15T23:15:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08407v1
"Silence of magnetic layers to magnetoresistive process and electronic

two polycrystalline magnetic compounds, LaMn$_2$Ge$_2$ and SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$,
previously reported by us, is made. A common feature for both these compounds
is that the low temperature MR is positive (say, below, 30 K) in spite of the
fact that both are ferromagnetic at such low temperatures; in addition, MR as a
function of magnetic field (H) does not track magnetization (M) in the sense
that M saturates at low fields, while MR varies linearly with H. These
observations suggest that the magnetic layers interestingly do not dominate low
temperature magnetotransport process. Interestingly enough, as the T is
increased, say around 100 K, these magnetic layers dominate MR process as
evidenced by the tracking of M and MR in SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$. These results tempts
us to propose that there is an unusual ""electronic separation"" for MR process
as the T is lowered in this class of compounds.","['E. V. Sampathkumaran', 'R. Mallik', 'P. L. Paulose', 'Subham Majumdar']",2000-02-17T17:34:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0002275v1
Magnetoresistance From Quantum Interference Effects in Ferromagnets,"The desire to maximize the sensitivity of read/write heads and thus the
information density of magnetic storage devices has produced an intense
interest in the magnetoresistance (MR) of magnetic materials. Recent
discoveries include ""colossal"" MR of the manganites1-4 and the enhanced MR of
low carrier density ferromagnets4-6. In the low carrier density systems
investigated to date as well as the manganites, a key feature is that the
electrical conduction is due to a different set of electrons than the localized
electrons responsible for the magnetism. Here we propose a mechanism for
ferromagnetic MR originating from quantum interference effects, rather than
simple scattering. The new mechanism obtains in disordered low carrier density
magnets where the magnetism as well as the electrical conduction are due to the
same electrons. Here the MR is positive and only weakly temperature dependent
below the Curie point. This is very different from the MR seen when conduction
electrons and local moments can be treated separately, in which case the MR is
negative and strongly peaked at the Curie point.","['N. Manyala', 'Y Siids', 'J. F. DiTusa', 'G. Aeppli', 'D. P. Young', 'Z. Fisk']",2000-05-31T17:15:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0005540v1
Bipolar-Driven Large Magnetoresistance in Silicon,"Large linear magnetoresistance (MR) in electron-injected p-type silicon at

large linear MR is induced in electron-dominated space-charge transport regime,
where the magnetic field modulation of electron-to-hole density ratio controls
the MR, as indicated by the magnetic field dependence of Hall coefficient in
the silicon device. Contrary to the space-charge-induced MR effect in unipolar
silicon device, where the large linear MR is inhomogeneity-induced, our results
provide a different insight into the mechanism of large linear MR in
non-magnetic semiconductors that is not based on the inhomogeneity model. This
approach enables homogeneous semiconductors to exhibit large linear MR at low

Anomalous magnetoresistance and magnetocaloric properties of NdRu2Ge2,"It is found that the polycrystalline NdRu2Ge2 undergoes two successive
magnetic transitions at Tt=10 K and TN=19 K. Evidence of metamagnetic
transition is detected in the magnetization isotherm data in the
antiferromagnetic regime. Temperature dependence of magnetoresistance (MR) show
that the relative magnitudes of MR at TN and Tt change considerably as the
field is increased from 10 kOe to 30 kOe. Moreover, the MR is found to be
positive below 9 K for 30 kOe field although the material is ferromagnetic at
these temperatures. The highest value of negative MR near TN is about 42% in a
field of 30 kOe, while the positive MR is about 35 % at 3 K in a field of 50
kOe. Like MR, the magnetocaloric effect at TN and Tt also shows anomalous
behavior. The relative magnitudes of MCE at these temperatures are found to
change with increase in field. It appears that the high field (>10 kOe)

"Linear magneto-resistance versus weak antilocalization effects in

magneto-resistance (MR) effects are widely discussed: a positive MR dip around
zero magnetic field associated with the weak antilocalization (WAL) effect and
a linear MR effect which generally persists to high fields and high
temperatures. We have studied the MR of topological insulator Bi2Te3 films from
the metallic to semiconducting transport regime. While in metallic samples, the
WAL is difficult to identify due to the smallness of the WAL compared to the
samples' conductivity, the sharp WAL dip in the MR is clearly present in the
samples with higher resistivity. To correctly account for the low field MR by
the quantitative theory of WAL according to the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka (HLN)

the WAL quantum correction. Otherwise the WAL fitting alone yields an

Origin of planar Hall effect in type-II Weyl semimetal MoTe2,"Besides the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (MR), planar Hall effect
(PHE) is a newly emerging experimental tool to test the chiral anomaly or
nontrivial Berry curvature in Weyl semimetals (WSMs). However, the origins of
PHE in various systems are not fully distinguished and understood. Here we
perform a systematic study on the PHE and anisotropic MR (AMR) of Td-MoTe2, a
type-II WSM. Although the PHE and AMR curves can be well fitted by the
theoretical formulas, we demonstrate that the anisotropic resistivity arises
from the orbital MR (OMR), instead of the negative MR as expected in the chiral
anomaly effect. In contrast, the absence of negative MR indicates that the
large OMR dominates over the chiral anomaly effect. This explains why it is
difficult to measure negative MR in type-II WSMs. We argue that the measured
PHE can be related with the chiral anomaly only when the negative MR is
simultaneously observed.","['D. D. Liang', 'Y. J. Wang', 'W. L. Zhen', 'J. Yang', 'S. R. Weng', 'X. Yan', 'Y. Y. Han', 'W. Tong', 'L. Pi', 'W. K. Zhu', 'C. J. Zhang']",2018-09-05T01:24:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01290v1

interest, as it can provide both spatial and temporal information for clinical

the challenges for dynamic MR imaging. Most existing methods reconstruct
Dynamic MR images from incomplete k-space data under the guidance of compressed

However, long acquisition time makes the acquired MR image vulnerable to motion
artifacts. This leads to the need of accelerating the execution of the MR

maintaining a high image quality that can be used to observe brain lesions. The

Frequency-Supervised MR-to-CT Image Synthesis,"This paper strives to generate a synthetic computed tomography (CT) image

of CT images. To address this common limitation, we introduce
frequency-supervised deep networks to explicitly enhance high-frequency
MR-to-CT image reconstruction. We propose a frequency decomposition layer that
learns to decompose predicted CT outputs into low- and high-frequency

In this work, we propose a two-phase self-augmentation procedure to generate
high-quality pseudo-labeled MR-to-Text pairs: the first phase selects the most
informative MRs based on model's prediction uncertainty; with the selected MRs,
the second phase generates accurate responses by aggregating multiple perturbed
latent representations from each MR. Empirical experiments on two benchmark
datasets, FewShotWOZ and FewShotSGD, show that our method generally outperforms
existing self-training methods on both automatic and human evaluations.","['Wanyu Du', 'Hanjie Chen', 'Yangfeng Ji']",2022-05-19T16:25:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09661v2
"Exploring a Test Data-Driven Method for Selecting and Constraining
  Metamorphic Relations","Identifying and selecting high-quality Metamorphic Relations (MRs) is a
challenge in Metamorphic Testing (MT). While some techniques for automatically
selecting MRs have been proposed, they are either domain-specific or rely on
strict assumptions about the applicability of a pre-defined MRs. This paper
presents a preliminary evaluation of MetaTrimmer, a method for selecting and
constraining MRs based on test data. MetaTrimmer comprises three steps:
generating random test data inputs for the SUT (Step 1), performing test data
transformations and logging MR violations (Step 2), and conducting manual
inspections to derive constraints (Step 3). The novelty of MetaTrimmer is its
avoidance of complex prediction models that require labeled datasets regarding
the applicability of MRs. Moreover, MetaTrimmer facilitates the seamless
integration of MT with advanced fuzzing for test data generation. In a
preliminary evaluation, MetaTrimmer shows the potential to overcome existing
limitations and enhance MR effectiveness.","['Alejandra Duque-Torres', 'Dietmar Pfahl', 'Claus Klammer', 'Stefan Fischer']",2023-07-28T12:27:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15522v1

located inside the MRI control room and are connected to the robot with
pneumatic transmission lines and optical fibers. Free space experiments
indicated robot-assisted needle insertion error of 2.6$\pm$1.3 mm at an

"Pressure-Induced Negative-Positive Magnetoresistance Crossover Near

magnetoresistance (MR) in La_{0.8}Ag_{0.1}MnO_{3} near the metal-insulator
transition temperature. Our results showed that an increase in pressure results
in a decrease in the magnitude of negative MR. At pressures $P\geqslant5.6$ GPa
and magnetic fields up to 4 kOe, we observed a positive MR. However, with a
further increase in magnetic field (>4 kOe), the MR again became negative.
Therefore, we discovered a ""negative-positive"" MR crossover induced by high

"MRNaB: Mixed Reality-based Robot Navigation Interface using
  Optical-see-through MR-beacon","Recent advancements in robotics have led to the development of numerous
interfaces to enhance the intuitiveness of robot navigation. However, the
reliance on traditional 2D displays imposes limitations on the simultaneous
visualization of information. Mixed Reality (MR) technology addresses this
issue by enhancing the dimensionality of information visualization, allowing
users to perceive multiple pieces of information concurrently. This paper
proposes Mixed reality-based robot navigation interface using an
optical-see-through MR-beacon (MRNaB), a novel approach that incorporates an
MR-beacon, situated atop the real-world environment, to function as a signal
transmitter for robot navigation. This MR-beacon is designed to be persistent,
eliminating the need for repeated navigation inputs for the same location. Our
system is mainly constructed into four primary functions: ""Add"", ""Move"",
""Delete"", and ""Select"". These allow for the addition of a MR-beacon, location
movement, its deletion, and the selection of MR-beacon for navigation purposes,
respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed method was then validated
through experiments by comparing it with the traditional 2D system. As the
result, MRNaB was proven to increase the performance of the user when doing
navigation to a certain place subjectively and objectively. For additional

"Magnetorheological Payne effect in bidisperse MR fluids containing Fe
  nanorods and Fe3O4 nanospheres: a dynamic rheological study","The spherical Fe3O4 with 300 nm in diameter was synthesized by typical
thermal decomposition of Fe (III) organo-metallic precursor in polyol and
polyacrylic acid. Fe-nanorods were prepared by reducing Fe (III) nitrate in
presence of polyol-hydrazine-CTAB. Morphology and magnetic characterization of
the nanoparticles were performed by ESEM, XRD and VSM studies. We performed
detailed non-linear magnetorheological properties of three MR fluids (10 vol%)
containing isotropic Fe3O4 and anisotropic Fe-nanorods under both small and
large amplitude oscillatory flow. The MR samples demonstrated strong
magnetorheological Payne effect i.e. rapid stress relaxation under increasing
deformation and uniform magnetic field beyond linear viscoelastic region (LVR),
which has not been studied in-depth in conventional MR fluids. We have also
shown that stress softening was more pronounced for MR fluids with higher
anisotropic contents, in contrast to isotropic MR fluid. The onset strains for
LVR to non-linear region transition for anisotropic fluids were much lower than
that of isotropic spherical nanoparticle-containing fluid. The stronger MR
response for nanorod-containing MR fluids can be explained in terms of enhanced

The Architecture of Mr. DLib's Scientific Recommender-System API,"Recommender systems in academia are not widely available. This may be in part
due to the difficulty and cost of developing and maintaining recommender
systems. Many operators of academic products such as digital libraries and
reference managers avoid this effort, although a recommender system could
provide significant benefits to their users. In this paper, we introduce Mr.
DLib's ""Recommendations as-a-Service"" (RaaS) API that allows operators of
academic products to easily integrate a scientific recommender system into
their products. Mr. DLib generates recommendations for research articles but in
the future, recommendations may include call for papers, grants, etc. Operators
of academic products can request recommendations from Mr. DLib and display
these recommendations to their users. Mr. DLib can be integrated in just a few
hours or days; creating an equivalent recommender system from scratch would
require several months for an academic operator. Mr. DLib has been used by

The GENIUS Approach to Robust Mendelian Randomization Inference,"Mendelian randomization (MR) is a popular instrumental variable (IV)
approach, in which one or several genetic markers serve as IVs that can
sometimes be leveraged to recover valid inferences about a given
exposure-outcome causal association subject to unmeasured confounding. A key IV
identification condition known as the exclusion restriction states that the IV
cannot have a direct effect on the outcome which is not mediated by the
exposure in view. In MR studies, such an assumption requires an unrealistic
level of prior knowledge about the mechanism by which genetic markers causally
affect the outcome. As a result, possible violation of the exclusion
restriction can seldom be ruled out in practice. To address this concern, we
introduce a new class of IV estimators which are robust to violation of the
exclusion restriction under data generating mechanisms commonly assumed in MR
literature. The proposed approach named ""MR G-Estimation under No Interaction
with Unmeasured Selection"" (MR GENIUS) improves on Robins' G-estimation by
making it robust to both additive unmeasured confounding and violation of the
exclusion restriction assumption. In certain key settings, MR GENIUS reduces to
the estimator of Lewbel (2012) which is widely used in econometrics but appears
largely unappreciated in MR literature. More generally, MR GENIUS generalizes
Lewbel's estimator to several key practical MR settings, including
multiplicative causal models for binary outcome, multiplicative and odds ratio
exposure models, case control study design and censored survival outcomes.","['Eric J. Tchetgen Tchetgen', 'BaoLuo Sun', 'Stefan Walter']",2017-09-22T14:32:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07779v6
"Synthesizing CT from Ultrashort Echo-Time MR Images via Convolutional
  Neural Networks","With the increasing popularity of PET-MR scanners in clinical applications,
synthesis of CT images from MR has been an important research topic. Accurate
PET image reconstruction requires attenuation correction, which is based on the
electron density of tissues and can be obtained from CT images. While CT
measures electron density information for x-ray photons, MR images convey
information about the magnetic properties of tissues. Therefore, with the
advent of PET-MR systems, the attenuation coefficients need to be indirectly
estimated from MR images. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional
neural network (CNN) based method to synthesize head CT from ultra-short
echo-time (UTE) dual-echo MR images. Unlike traditional $T_1$-w images which do
not have any bone signal, UTE images show some signal for bone, which makes it
a good candidate for MR to CT synthesis. A notable advantage of our approach is
that accurate results were achieved with a small training data set. Using an
atlas of a single CT and dual-echo UTE pair, we train a deep neural network
model to learn the transform of MR intensities to CT using patches. We compared
our CNN based model with a state-of-the-art registration based as well as a
Bayesian model based CT synthesis method, and showed that the proposed CNN
model outperforms both of them. We also compared the proposed model when only
$T_1$-w images are available instead of UTE, and show that UTE images produce
better synthesis than using just $T_1$-w images.","['Snehashis Roy', 'John A. Butman', 'Dzung L. Pham']",2018-07-27T22:43:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10850v1
"Improving the efficiency of the multireference driven similarity
  renormalization group via sequential transformation, density fitting, and the
  non-interacting virtual orbital approximation","This study examines several techniques to improve the efficiency of the
linearized multireference driven similarity renormalization group truncated to
one- and two-body operators [MR-LDSRG(2)]. We propose a sequential MR-LDSRG(2)
[sq-MR-LDSRG(2)] approach, in which one-body rotations are folded exactly into
the Hamiltonian. This new approach is combined with density fitting (DF) to
reduce the storage cost of two-electron integrals. To further avoid the storage
of large four-index intermediates, we propose a non-interacting virtual orbit
(NIVO) approximation in which tensor blocks labeled by three and four virtual
indices are neglected. The NIVO approximation reduces the computational cost
prefactor of the MR-LDSRG(2) bringing it closer to that of coupled cluster with
singles and doubles (CCSD). We test the effect of the DF and NIVO
approximations on the MR-LDSRG(2) and sq-MR-LDSRG(2) methods by computing
properties of eight diatomic molecules. The diatomic constants obtained by
DF-sq-MR-LDSRG(2)+NIVO are found to be as accurate as those from the original
MR-LDSRG(2) and coupled cluster theory with singles, doubles, and perturbative
triples. Finally, we demonstrate that the DF-sq-MR-LDSRG(2)+NIVO scheme can be
applied to chemical systems with more than 550 basis functions by computing the
automerization energy of cyclobutadiene with a quintuple-zeta basis set. The
predicted automerization energy is found similar to the values computed with
Mukherjee's state-specific multireference coupled cluster theory with singles

"Extended Second-Order Multireference Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction
  Theory for Charged Excitations","We report a new implementation of multireference algebraic diagrammatic

our recent work on IP-MR-ADC [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2019, 15, 5908], we
present the first implementation of the second-order MR-ADC method for electron
attachment (EA-MR-ADC(2)), as well as two extended second-order approximations
(EA- and IP-MR-ADC(2)-X) that incorporate a partial treatment of third-order
electron correlation effects. Introducing a small approximation for the
second-order amplitudes of the effective Hamiltonian, our implementation of EA-

size M. Additionally, we describe an efficient algorithm for solving the
first-order amplitude equations in MR-ADC and partially-contracted second-order
N-electron valence perturbation theory (NEVPT2) that completely avoids
computation of the four-particle reduced density matrices without introducing
any approximations or imaginary-time propagation. For a benchmark set of eight
small molecules, carbon dimer, and a twisted ethylene, we demonstrate that EA-

"MR-Contrast-Aware Image-to-Image Translations with Generative
  Adversarial Networks","Purpose
  A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exam typically consists of several
sequences that yield different image contrasts. Each sequence is parameterized
through multiple acquisition parameters that influence image contrast,
signal-to-noise ratio, acquisition time, and/or resolution. Depending on the
clinical indication, different contrasts are required by the radiologist to
make a diagnosis. As MR sequence acquisition is time consuming and acquired
images may be corrupted due to motion, a method to synthesize MR images with
adjustable contrast properties is required.
  Methods
  Therefore, we trained an image-to-image generative adversarial network
conditioned on the MR acquisition parameters repetition time and echo time. Our
approach is motivated by style transfer networks, whereas the ""style"" for an
image is explicitly given in our case, as it is determined by the MR
acquisition parameters our network is conditioned on.
  Results
  This enables us to synthesize MR images with adjustable image contrast. We
evaluated our approach on the fastMRI dataset, a large set of publicly
available MR knee images, and show that our method outperforms a benchmark
pix2pix approach in the translation of non-fat-saturated MR images to
fat-saturated images. Our approach yields a peak signal-to-noise ratio and
structural similarity of 24.48 and 0.66, surpassing the pix2pix benchmark model
significantly.
  Conclusion
  Our model is the first that enables fine-tuned contrast synthesis, which can
be used to synthesize missing MR contrasts or as a data augmentation technique
for AI training in MRI.","['Jonas Denck', 'Jens Guehring', 'Andreas Maier', 'Eva Rothgang']",2021-04-03T17:05:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01449v1
"Aldosterone and Dexamethasone Activate African Lungfish
  Mineralocorticoid Receptor: Increased Activation After Removal of the
  Amino-Terminal Domain","Aldosterone, the main physiological mineralocorticoid in humans and other
terrestrial vertebrates, first appears in lungfish, which are lobe-finned fish
that are forerunners of terrestrial vertebrates. Aldosterone activation of the
MR regulates internal homeostasis of water, sodium and potassium, which was
critical in the conquest of land by vertebrates. We studied transcriptional
activation of the slender African lungfish MR by aldosterone, other
corticosteroids and progesterone and find that aldosterone,
11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol and progesterone have half-maximal
responses (EC50s) below 1 nM and are potential physiological
mineralocorticoids. In contrast, EC50s for corticosterone and cortisol were 23
nM and 66 nM, respectively. Unexpectedly, truncated lungfish MR, consisting of
the DNA-binding, hinge and steroid-binding domains, had a stronger response to
corticosteroids and progesterone than full-length lungfish MR, indicating that
the N-terminal domain represses steroid activation of lungfish MR, unlike human
MR in which the N-terminal domain contains an activation function. BLAST
searches of GenBank did not retrieve a GR ortholog, leading us to test
dexamethasone and triamcinolone for activation of lungfish MR. At 10 nM, both
synthetic glucocorticoids are about 4-fold stronger than 10 nM aldosterone in
activating full-length lungfish MR, leading us to propose that lungfish MR also
functions as a GR.","['Yoshinao Katsu', 'Shin Oana', 'Xiaozhi Lin', 'Susumu Hyodo', 'Michael E. Baker']",2021-06-27T00:17:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14114v1
Effective Mutation Rate Adaptation through Group Elite Selection,"Evolutionary algorithms are sensitive to the mutation rate (MR); no single
value of this parameter works well across domains. Self-adaptive MR approaches
have been proposed but they tend to be brittle: Sometimes they decay the MR to
zero, thus halting evolution. To make self-adaptive MR robust, this paper
introduces the Group Elite Selection of Mutation Rates (GESMR) algorithm. GESMR
co-evolves a population of solutions and a population of MRs, such that each MR
is assigned to a group of solutions. The resulting best mutational change in
the group, instead of average mutational change, is used for MR selection
during evolution, thus avoiding the vanishing MR problem. With the same number
of function evaluations and with almost no overhead, GESMR converges faster and
to better solutions than previous approaches on a wide range of continuous test
optimization problems. GESMR also scales well to high-dimensional
neuroevolution for supervised image-classification tasks and for reinforcement
learning control tasks. Remarkably, GESMR produces MRs that are optimal in the
long-term, as demonstrated through a comprehensive look-ahead grid search.
Thus, GESMR and its theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrate how
self-adaptation can be harnessed to improve performance in several applications
of evolutionary computation.","['Akarsh Kumar', 'Bo Liu', 'Risto Miikkulainen', 'Peter Stone']",2022-04-11T01:08:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04817v1
"Magnetic Resonance Image Processing Transformer for General
  Reconstruction","Purpose: To develop and evaluate a deep learning model for general
accelerated MRI reconstruction.
  Materials and Methods: This retrospective study built a magnetic resonance
image processing transformer (MR-IPT) which includes multi-head-tails and a
single shared window transformer main body. Three mutations of MR-IPT with
different transformer structures were implemented to guide the design of our
MR-IPT model. Pre-trained on the MRI set of RadImageNet including 672675 images
with multiple anatomy categories, the model was further migrated and evaluated
on fastMRI knee dataset with 25012 images for downstream reconstruction tasks.
We performed comparison studies with three CNN-based conventional networks in
zero- and few-shot learning scenarios. Transfer learning process was conducted
on both MR-IPT and CNN networks to further validate the generalizability of
MR-IPT. To study the model performance stability, we evaluated our model with
various downstream dataset sizes ranging from 10 to 2500 images.
  Result: The MR-IPT model provided superior performance in multiple downstream
tasks compared to conventional CNN networks. MR-IPT achieved a PSNR/SSIM of
26.521/0.6102 (4-fold) and 24.861/0.4996 (8-fold) in 10-epoch learning,
surpassing UNet128 at 25.056/0.5832 (4-fold) and 22.984/0.4637 (8-fold). With
the same large-scale pre-training, MR-IPT provided a 5% performance boost
compared to UNet128 in zero-shot learning in 8-fold and 3% in 4-fold.

"Real-time non-rigid 3D respiratory motion estimation for MR-guided
  radiotherapy using MR-MOTUS","The MR-Linac is a combination of an MR-scanner and radiotherapy linear
accelerator (Linac) which holds the promise to increase the precision of
radiotherapy treatments with MR-guided radiotherapy by monitoring motion during
radiotherapy with MRI, and adjusting the radiotherapy plan accordingly. Optimal
MR-guidance for respiratory motion during radiotherapy requires MR-based 3D
motion estimation with a latency of 200-500 ms. Currently this is still
challenging since typical methods rely on MR-images, and are therefore limited
by the 3D MR-imaging latency. In this work, we present a method to perform
non-rigid 3D respiratory motion estimation with 170 ms latency, including both
acquisition and reconstruction. The proposed method called real-time low-rank
MR-MOTUS reconstructs motion-fields directly from k-space data, and leverages
an explicit low-rank decomposition of motion-fields to split the large scale
3D+t motion-field reconstruction problem posed in our previous work into two
parts: (I) a medium-scale offline preparation phase and (II) a small-scale
online inference phase which exploits the results of the offline phase for
real-time computations. The method was validated on free-breathing data of five
volunteers, acquired with a 1.5T Elekta Unity MR-Linac. Results show that the
reconstructed 3D motion-field are anatomically plausible, highly correlated
with a self-navigation motion surrogate (R = 0.975 +/- 0.0110), and can be
reconstructed with a total latency of 170 ms that is sufficient for real-time

magnetic-field, due to the orthogonality of the wavefunctions. A finite
magnetic-field introduces the quantum hall-like effect, which distorts the
wavefunctions. Thus, a finite transmission occurs across the heterojunction,
giving rise to a large MR effect. We study the dependence of this MR on
temperature and electron energy. Finally, we design a

"On Using Signal Magnitude in Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Measurements
  of Restricted Motion","Tissue microstructure has significance as a biomarker, however its accurate
inference with diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) is still an open problem. With
few exceptions, diffusion weighted (DW) MR models either process diffusion MR
data using signal magnitude, whereby microstructural information is forcefully
confined to symmetry due to Fourier transform properties, or directly use
symmetric basis expansions.
  Herein, information loss from magnitude utilization is demonstrated by
numerically simulating particles undergoing diffusion near a fully reflective
infinite wall and an orthogonal corner.
  Simulation results show that the loss of the Hermitian property when using
signal magnitude impedes DW--MR from accurately inferring microstructural

that the Kohler rule works for the transverse MR. The Kohler rule is also

sharp deviation of longitudinal MR curve for sample with low RRR from the
Kohler prediction at high fields reveals its tendency to a sign change at

distribution of ratio estimates around the true causal effect, MR-Local selects
the cluster of ratio estimates with the least uncertainty and performs causal

"Exploring the spectral \textit{information content} in the LAMOST
  medium-resolution survey (MRS)","Low-resolution spectra are proved competitive to high-resolution spectra in
determining many stellar labels at comparable precision. It is useful to
consider the spectral information content when assessing the capability of a
stellar spectrum in deriving precise stellar labels. In this work, we quantify
the information content brought by the LAMOST-II medium-resolution
spectroscopic survey (MRS) using the gradient spectra and the
coefficients-of-dependence (CODs). In general, the wavelength coverage of the
MRS well constrains the stellar labels but the sensitivities of different
stellar labels vary with spectral types and metallicity of the stars of
interest and, therefore, affect the performance of the stellar label
determination from the MRS spectra. Applying the SLAM to the synthetic spectra
which mimic the MRS data, we find the precision of the fundamental stellar
parameters Teff, logg and [M/H] are better when combining both the blue and red
bands of the MRS. This is especially important for warm stars since the
H$\alpha$ line located in the red part plays a more important role in
determining the effective temperature for warm stars. With blue and red parts
together, we are able to reach similar performance to the low-resolution
spectra except for warm stars. However, at [M/H]$\sim-2.0$ dex, the
uncertainties of fundamental stellar labels estimated from MRS are
substantially larger than those from low-resolution spectra. We also tested the
uncertainties of Teff, logg and [M/H] of from MRS data induced from the radial
velocity mismatch and find that a mismatch of about 1 km s$^{-1}$, which is
typical for LAMOST MRS data, would not significantly affect the stellar label
estimates. At last, reference precision limits are calculated using synthetic
gradient spectra, according to which we expect abundances of at least 17
elements to be measured precisely from MRS spectra.","['Bo Zhang', 'Chao Liu', 'Chun-Qian Li', 'Li-Cai Deng', 'Tai-Sheng Yan', 'Jian-Rong Shi']",2019-10-29T09:47:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13154v1
The stellar-subhalo mass relation of satellite galaxies,"We extend the abundance matching technique (AMT) to infer the
satellite-subhalo and central-halo mass relations (MRs) of galaxies, as well as
the corresponding satellite conditional mass functions (CMFs). We use the
observed galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) decomposed into centrals and
satellites and the LCDM halo/subhalo mass functions as inputs. We explore the
effects of defining the subhalo mass at the time of accretion (m_acc) vs. at
the time of observation (m_obs). We test the standard assumption that centrals
and satellites follow the same MRs, showing that this assumption leads to
predictions in disagreement with observations, specially for m_obs. Instead,
when the satellite-subhalo MRs are constrained following our AMT, they are
always different from the central-halo MR: the smaller the stellar mass (Ms),
the less massive is the subhalo of satellites as compared to the halo of
centrals of the same Ms. On average, for Ms<2x10^11Msol, the dark mass of
satellites decreased by 60-65% with respect to their masses at accretion time.
The resulting MRs for both definitions of subhalo mass yield satellite CMFs in
agreement with observations. Also, when these MRs are used in a HOD model, the
predicted correlation functions agree with observations. We show that the use
of m_obs leads to less uncertain MRs than m_acc, and discuss implications of
the obtained satellite-subhalo MR. For example, we show that the tension
between abundance and dynamics of MW satellites in LCDM gives if the slope of
the GSMF faint-end slope upturns to -1.6.","['A. Rodriguez-Puebla', 'N. Drory', 'V. Avila-Reese']",2012-04-03T20:30:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.0804v2
3T MR-Guided Brachytherapy for Gynecologic Malignancies,"Gynecologic malignancies are a leading cause of death in women worldwide.
Standard treatment for many primary and recurrent gynecologic cancer cases
includes a combination of external beam radiation, followed by brachytherapy.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is benefitial in diagnostic evaluation, in
mapping the tumor location to tailor radiation dose, and in monitoring the
tumor response to treatment. Initial studies of MR-guidance in gynecologic
brachtherapy demonstrate the ability to optimize tumor coverage and reduce
radiation dose to normal tissues, resulting in improved outcomes for patients.
In this article we describe a methodology to aid applicator placement and
treatment planning for 3 Tesla (3T) MR-guided brachytherapy that was developed
specifically for gynecologic cancers. This has been used in 18 cases to date in
the Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operating suite at Brigham and Women's
Hospital. It is comprised of state of the art methods for MR imaging, image
analysis, and treatment planning. An MR sequence using 3D-balanced steady state
free precession in a 3T MR scan was identified as the best sequence for
catheter identification with ballooning artifact at the tip. 3D treatment
planning was performed using MR images. Item in development include a software
module designed to support virtual needle trajectory planning that includes
probabilistic bias correction, graph based segmentation, and image registration

"Novel decision-theoretic and risk-stratification metrics of predictive
  performance: Application to deciding who should undergo genetic testing","Currently, women are referred for BRCA1/2 mutation-testing only if their
family-history of breast/ovarian cancer implies that their risk of carrying a
mutation exceeds 10\%. However, as mutation-testing costs fall, prominent
voices have called for testing all women, which would strain clinical resources
by testing millions of women, almost all of whom will test negative. To better
evaluate risk-thresholds for BRCA1/2 testing, we introduce two broadly
applicable, linked metrics: Mean Risk Stratification (MRS) and a
decision-theoretic metric, Net Benefit of Information (NBI). MRS and NBI
provide a range of risk thresholds at which a marker/model is ""optimally
informative"", in the sense of maximizing both MRS and NBI. NBI is a function of
only MRS and the risk-threshold for action, connecting decision-theory to
risk-stratification and providing a decision-theoretic rationale for MRS. AUC
and Youden's index reflect on both the fraction of maximum MRS, and of maximum
NBI, attained by the marker/model, providing AUC and Youden's index with
long-sought decision-theoretic and risk-stratification rationale. To evaluate
risk-thresholds for BRCA1/2 testing, we propose an eclectic approach
considering AUC, Net Benefit, and MRS/NBI. MRS/NBI interpret AUC in the context
of mutation-prevalence and provide a range of risk thresholds for which the
risk model is optimally informative.",['Hormuzd A. Katki'],2017-11-15T17:34:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05686v1
"An Aristotelian view on MR-based attenuation correction (ARISTOMRAC):
  combining the four elements","MR-based attenuation correction (MRAC) is important for accurate
quantification of the uptake of PET tracers in combined PET/MR scanners.
However, current techniques for MRAC usually require multiple acquisitions or
complex post-processing to discriminate the different tissues. Inspired by the
ancient Greeks, who believed that matter was made of the combination of four
elements (earth, water, air and fire), we formulated a multi-component Magnetic
Resonance (MR) Fingerprinting framework, where every voxel was considered a
weighted combination of four base elements: bone, water, air and fat. We named
our approach Aristotelian MR based attenuation correction (ARISTOMRAC). We used
a 3D radial acquisition scheme at 1.5T, acquiring a transient-state spoiled
acquisition with variable flip angles and echo times (TE), with the shortest
TEs being ultra-short echo times (UTE). We simulated a multi-tissue MR signal
model using the Bloch equations and used dictionary matching to extract tissue
fraction maps for bone water and fat, while air fractions were obtained by
thresholding the UTE parts of our acquisitions at higher spatial resolution.
Compared to previous methods for MR-based Attenuation Correction (MRAC), our
approach used a full multi-component signal model, including multiple tissues
per voxel. For this reason, rather than reconstructing high resolutions images,
MR data can be acquired more efficiently, directly at the resolution needed for
PET attenuation maps. The ARISTOMRAC method allows to accurately estimate the
air, water, bone and fat fractions (Concordance Correlation Coefficient =
0.81/0.91/0.98 for bone, water and fat respectively). Attenuation maps could be
obtained in the head and neck with a single 1-minute acquisition.","['Matteo Cencini', 'Michela Tosetti', 'Guido Buonincontri']",2019-06-10T15:44:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04077v1
"Gigantic negative magnetoresistance in a disordered topological
  insulator","With the recent discovery of Weyl semimetals, the phenomenon of negative
magnetoresistance (MR) is attracting renewed interest. While small negative MR
can occur due to the suppression of spin scattering or weak localization, large
negative MR is rare in materials, and when it happens, it is usually related to
magnetism. The large negative MR in Weyl semimetals is peculiar in that it is
unrelated to magnetism and comes from chiral anomaly. Here we report that there
is a new mechanism for large negative MR which is not related to magnetism but
is related to disorder. In the newly-synthesized bulk-insulating topological
insulator TlBi$_{0.15}$Sb$_{0.85}$Te$_2$, we observed gigantic negative MR
reaching 98% in 14 T at 10 K, which is unprecedented in a nonmagnetic system.
Supported by numerical simulations, we argue that this phenomenon is likely due
to the Zeeman effect on a barely percolating current path formed in the
disordered bulk. Since disorder can also lead to non-saturating linear MR in
Ag$_{2+\delta}$Se, the present finding suggests that disorder engineering in
narrow-gap systems is useful for realizing gigantic MR in both positive and
negative directions.","['Oliver Breunig', 'Zhiwei Wang', 'A. A. Taskin', 'Jonathan Lux', 'Achim Rosch', 'Yoichi Ando']",2017-03-31T08:02:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10784v2
Insights into brain microstructure from in vivo DW-MRS,"Many developmental processes, such as plasticity and aging, or pathological
processes such as neurological diseases are characterized by modulations of
specific cellular types and their microstructures. Diffusion-weighted Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI) is a powerful technique for probing microstructure,
yet its information arises from the ubiquitous, non-specific water signal. By
contrast, diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (DW-MRS) allows
specific characterizations of tissues such as brain and muscle in vivo by
quantifying the diffusion properties of MR-observable metabolites. Many brain
metabolites are predominantly intracellular, and some of them are
preferentially localized in specific brain cell populations, e.g., neurons and
glia. Given the microstructural sensitivity of diffusion-encoding filters,
investigation of metabolite diffusion properties using DW-MRS can thus provide
exclusive cell and compartment-specific information. Furthermore, since many
models and assumptions are used for quantification of water diffusion,
metabolite diffusion may serve to generate a-priori information for model
selection in DW-MRI. However, DW-MRS measurements are extremely challenging,
from the acquisition to the accurate and correct analysis and quantification
stages. In this review, we survey the state-of-the-art methods that have been
developed for the robust acquisition, quantification and analysis of DW-MRS
data and discuss the potential relevance of DW-MRS for elucidating brain
microstructure in vivo. The review highlights that when accurate data on the
diffusion of multiple metabolites is combined with accurate computational and
geometrical modelling, DW-MRS can provide unique cell-specific information on
the intracellular structure of brain tissue, in health and disease, which could
serve as incentives for further application in vivo in human (...)","['Marco Palombo', 'Noam Shemesh', 'Itamar Ronen', 'Julien Valette']",2019-03-19T17:05:03Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10378v1
"Optimal input configuration of dynamic contrast enhanced MRI in
  convolutional neural networks for liver segmentation","Most MRI liver segmentation methods use a structural 3D scan as input, such
as a T1 or T2 weighted scan. Segmentation performance may be improved by
utilizing both structural and functional information, as contained in dynamic
contrast enhanced (DCE) MR series. Dynamic information can be incorporated in a
segmentation method based on convolutional neural networks in a number of ways.
In this study, the optimal input configuration of DCE MR images for
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is studied. The performance of three
different input configurations for CNNs is studied for a liver segmentation
task. The three configurations are I) one phase image of the DCE-MR series as
input image; II) the separate phases of the DCE-MR as input images; and III)
the separate phases of the DCE-MR as channels of one input image. The three
input configurations are fed into a dilated fully convolutional network and
into a small U-net. The CNNs were trained using 19 annotated DCE-MR series and
tested on another 19 annotated DCE-MR series. The performance of the three
input configurations for both networks is evaluated against manual annotations.
The results show that both neural networks perform better when the separate
phases of the DCE-MR series are used as channels of an input image in
comparison to one phase as input image or the separate phases as input images.
No significant difference between the performances of the two network
architectures was found for the separate phases as channels of an input image.","['Mariëlle J. A. Jansen', 'Hugo J. Kuijf', 'Josien P. W. Pluim']",2019-08-22T08:27:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08251v1
"Deep learning-based synthetic CT generation from MR images: comparison
  of generative adversarial and residual neural networks","Currently, MRI-only radiotherapy (RT) eliminates some of the concerns about
using CT images in RT chains such as the registration of MR images to a
separate CT, extra dose delivery, and the additional cost of repeated imaging.
However, one remaining challenge is that the signal intensities of MRI are not
related to the attenuation coefficient of the biological tissue. This work
compares the performance of two state-of-the-art deep learning models; a
generative adversarial network (GAN) and a residual network (ResNet) for
synthetic CTs (sCT) generation from MR images. The brain MR and CT images of 86
participants were analyzed. GAN and ResNet models were implemented for the
generation of synthetic CTs from the 3D T1-weighted MR images using a six-fold
cross-validation scheme. The resulting sCTs were compared, considering the CT
images as a reference using standard metrics such as the mean absolute error
(MAE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the structural similarity index
(SSIM). Overall, the ResNet model exhibited higher accuracy in relation to the
delineation of brain tissues. The ResNet model estimated the CT values for the
entire head region with an MAE of 114.1 HU compared to MAE=-10.9 HU obtained
from the GAN model. Moreover, both models offered comparable SSIM and PSNR
values, although the ResNet method exhibited a slightly superior performance
over the GAN method. We compared two state-of-the-art deep learning models for
the task of MR-based sCT generation. The ResNet model exhibited superior
results, thus demonstrating its potential to be used for the challenge of

"Meta Preference Learning for Fast User Adaptation in Human-Supervisory
  Multi-Robot Deployments","As multi-robot systems (MRS) are widely used in various tasks such as natural
disaster response and social security, people enthusiastically expect an MRS to
be ubiquitous that a general user without heavy training can easily operate.
However, humans have various preferences on balancing between task performance
and safety, imposing different requirements onto MRS control. Failing to comply
with preferences makes people feel difficult in operation and decreases human
willingness of using an MRS. Therefore, to improve social acceptance as well as
performance, there is an urgent need to adjust MRS behaviors according to human
preferences before triggering human corrections, which increases cognitive
load. In this paper, a novel Meta Preference Learning (MPL) method was
developed to enable an MRS to fast adapt to user preferences. MPL based on meta
learning mechanism can quickly assess human preferences from limited
instructions; then, a neural network based preference model adjusts MRS
behaviors for preference adaption. To validate method effectiveness, a task
scenario ""An MRS searches victims in an earthquake disaster site"" was designed;
20 human users were involved to identify preferences as ""aggressive"", ""medium"",
""reserved""; based on user guidance and domain knowledge, about 20,000

"Bug or not Bug? Analysing the Reasons Behind Metamorphic Relation
  Violations","Metamorphic Testing (MT) is a testing technique that can effectively
alleviate the oracle problem. MT uses Metamorphic Relations (MRs) to determine
if a test case passes or fails. MRs specify how the outputs should vary in
response to specific input changes when executing the System Under Test (SUT).
If a particular MR is violated for at least one test input (and its change),
there is a high probability that the SUT has a fault. On the other hand, if a
particular MR is not violated, it does not guarantee that the SUT is fault
free. However, deciding if the MR is being violated due to a bug or because the
MR does not hold/fit for particular conditions generated by specific inputs
remains a manual task and unexplored. In this paper, we develop a method for
refining MRs to offer hints as to whether a violation results from a bug or
arises from the MR not being matched to certain test data under specific
circumstances. In our initial proof-of-concept, we derive the relevant
information from rules using the Association Rule Mining (ARM) technique. In

Due to resonant transport through discrete energy levels in a finite CNT, the
conductance and MR are oscillating as a function of the CNT Fermi energy. The
MR is peaked at the conductance valleys and dipped close to the conductance
peaks. When couplings to two FM electrodes are asymmetric, the MR dips become
negative under a rather strong asymmetry. When couplings are more or less

Under strong coupling case, the line broadening is significant and transport

"Extraordinary magnetoresistance in graphite: experimental evidence for
  the time-reversal symmetry breaking","The ordinary magnetoresistance (MR) of doped semiconductors is positive and
quadratic in a low magnetic field, B, as it should be in the framework of the
Boltzmann kinetic theory or in the conventional hopping regime. We observe an
unusual highly-anisotropic in-plane MR in graphite, which is neither quadratic
nor always positive. In a certain current direction MR is negative and linear
in B in fields below a few tens of mT with a crossover to a positive MR at
higher fields, while in a perpendicular current direction we observe a giant
super-linear and positive MR. These extraordinary MRs are respectively
explained by a hopping magneto-conductance via non-zero angular momentum
orbitals, and by the magneto-conductance of inhomogeneous media. The linear
orbital NMR is a unique signature of the broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) in
graphite. While some local paramagnetic centers could be responsible for the
broken TRS, the observed large diamagnetism suggests a more intriguing
mechanism of this breaking, involving superconducting clusters with
unconventional (chiral) order parameters and spontaneously generated
normal-state current loops in graphite.","['Y. Kopelevich', 'R. R. da Silva', 'A. S. Alexandrov']",2012-02-25T11:14:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5642v1
"Negative Magnetoresistance without Chiral Anomaly in Topological
  Insulators","An intriguing phenomenon in topological semimetals and topological insulators
is the negative magnetoresistance (MR) observed when a magnetic field is
applied along the current direction. A prevailing understanding to the negative
MR in topological semimetals is the chiral anomaly, which, however, is not well
defined in topological insulators. We calculate the MR of a three-dimensional
topological insulator, by using the semiclassical equations of motion, in which
the Berry curvature explicitly induces an anomalous velocity and orbital
moment. Our theoretical results are in quantitative agreement with the
experiments. The negative MR is not sensitive to temperature and increases as
the Fermi energy approaches the band edge. The orbital moment and g factors
also play important roles in the negative MR. Our results give a reasonable
explanation to the negative MR in 3D topological insulators and will be helpful
in understanding the anomalous quantum transport in topological states of
matter.","['Xin Dai', 'Z. Z. Du', 'Hai-Zhou Lu']",2017-05-08T02:06:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02724v3
"Possible magnetic-polaron-switched positive and negative
  magnetoresistance in the GdSi single crystal","Magnetoresistance (MR) has attracted tremendous attention for possible
technological applications. Understanding the role of magnetism in manipulating
MR may in turn steer the searching for new applicable MR materials. Here we
show that antiferromagnetic (AFM) GdSi metal displays an anisotropic positive
MR value (PMRV), up to $\sim$ 415%, accompanied by a large negative thermal
volume expansion (NTVE). Around $T_\text{N}$ the PMRV translates to negative,
down to $\sim$ -10.5%. Their theory-breaking magnetic-field dependencies [PMRV:
dominantly linear; negative MR value (NMRV): quadratic] and the unusual NTVE
indicate that PMRV is induced by the formation of magnetic polarons in 5$d$
bands, whereas NMRV is possibly due to abated electron-spin scattering
resulting from magnetic-field-aligned local 4$f$ spins. Our results may open up
a new avenue of searching for giant MR materials by suppressing the AFM
transition temperature, opposite the case in manganites, and provide a
promising approach to novel magnetic and electric devices.","['Hai-Feng Li', 'Yinguo Xiao', 'Berthold Schmitz', 'Jörg Persson', 'Wolfgang Schmidt', 'Paul Meuffels', 'Georg Roth', 'Thomas Brückel']",2015-02-03T08:05:02Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00774v1
Giant semiclassical magnetoresistance in high mobility TaAs2 semimetal,"We report the observation of colossal positive magnetoresistance (MR) in
single crystalline, high mobility TaAs2 semimetal. The excellent fit of MR by a
single quadratic function of the magnetic field B over a wide temperature range
(T = 2-300 K) suggests the semiclassical nature of the MR. The measurements of
Hall effect and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, as well as band structure
calculations suggest that the giant MR originates from the nearly perfectly
compensated electrons and holes in TaAs2. The quadratic MR can even exceed
1,200,000% at B = 9 T and T = 2 K, which is one of the largest values among
those of all known semi-metallic compounds including the very recently
discovered WTe2 and NbSb2. The giant positive magnetoresistance in TaAs2, which
not only has a fundamentally different origin from the negative colossal MR

Large Magnetoresistance in Compensated Semimetals TaAs$_2$ and NbAs$_2$,"We report large magnetoresistance (MR) at low temperatures in
single-crystalline nonmagnetic compounds TaAs$_2$ and NbAs$_2$. Both compounds
exhibit parabolic-field-dependent MR larger than $5\times10^3$ in a magnetic
field of 9 Tesla at 2 K. The MR starts to deviate from parabolic dependence
above 10 T and intends to be saturated in 45 T for TaAs$_2$ at 4.2 K. The Hall
resistance measurements and band structural calculations reveal their
compensated semimetal characteristics. The large MR at low temperatures is
ascribed to a resonance effect of the balanced electrons and holes with large
mobilities. We also discuss the relation of the MR and samples' quality for
TaAs$_2$ and other semimetals. We found that the magnitudes of MR are strongly
dependent on the samples' quality for different compounds.","['Zhujun Yuan', 'Hong Lu', 'Yongjie Liu', 'Junfeng Wang', 'Shuang Jia']",2016-01-25T05:54:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06482v1
Improved energy production of multi-rotor wind farms,"The multi-rotor (MR) wind turbine concept can be used to upscale wind
turbines without increasing the rotor diameter, which can be beneficial for
transport, manufacture and design of wind turbines blades. The rotor
interaction of a MR wind turbine leads to a faster wake recovery compared to an
equivalent single-rotor (SR) wind turbine wake. In this article, the benefit of
the faster wake recovery of MR wind turbines is quantified using
Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations of a 4x4 rectangular MR wind farm,
for three different inter wind turbine spacings. The simulations predict an
increase of 0.3-1.7% in annual energy production for the MR wind farm with
respect to an equivalent SR wind farm, where the highest gain is obtained for
the tightest inter wind turbine spacing. The gain in AEP is mainly caused by
the aligned wind directions for the first downstream wind turbine in a wind
turbine row of the MR wind farm, which is verified by an additional large-eddy
simulation.","['M. Paul van der Laan', 'Mahdi Abkar']",2019-07-16T14:00:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07012v1
Magnetization and magneto-transport measurements on CeBi single crystals,"We report the synthesis of CeBi single crystals out of Bi self flux and a
systematic study of the magnetic and transport properties with varying
temperature and applied magnetic fields. From these $R(T,H)$ and $M(T,H)$ data
we could assemble the field-temperature ($H-T$) phase diagram for CeBi and
visualize the three dimensional $M-T-H$ surface. In the phase diagram, we
identify regions with well defined magnetization values, and identify a new
phase region. The magnetoresistance (MR) in the low temperature regime shows,
above $6~$T a power-law, non-saturated behavior with large MR ($\sim
3\times10^5 \%$ at $2~$K and $13.95~$T), along with Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations. With increasing temperatures, MR decreases, and then becomes
negative for $T\gtrsim 10~$K. This crossover in MR seems to be unrelated to any
specific magnetic or metamagnetic transitions, but rather is associated with
changing from a low-temperature normal metal regime with little or no
scattering from the Ce$^{3+}$ moments and an anomalously large MR, to an
increased scattering from local Ce moments and a negative MR as temperature
increases.","['Brinda Kuthanazhi', 'Na Hyun Jo', 'Li Xiang', ""Sergey L. Bud'ko"", 'Paul C. Canfield']",2019-12-18T21:23:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08896v2
Why Condorcet Consistency is Essential,"In a single winner election with several candidates and ranked choice or
rating scale ballots, a Condorcet winner is one who wins all their two way
races by majority rule or MR. A voting system has Condorcet consistency or CC
if it names any Condorcet winner the winner. Many voting systems lack CC, but a
three step line of reasoning is used here to show why it is necessary. In step
1 we show that we can dismiss all the electoral criteria which conflict with
CC. In step 2 we point out that CC follows almost automatically if we can agree
that MR is the only acceptable system for elections with two candidates. In
step 3 we make that argument for MR. This argument itself has three parts.
First, in races with two candidates, the only well known alternatives to MR can
sometimes name as winner a candidate who is preferred over their opponent by
only one voter, with all others preferring the opponent. That is unacceptable.
Second, those same systems are also extremely susceptible to strategic
insincere voting. Third, in simulation studies using spatial models with two
candidates, the best known alternative to MR picks the best or most centrist
candidate significantly less often than MR does.",['Richard B. Darlington'],2017-06-06T16:18:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01841v1
Accelerating MR Imaging via Deep Chambolle-Pock Network,"Compressed sensing (CS) has been introduced to accelerate data acquisition in
MR Imaging. However, CS-MRI methods suffer from detail loss with large
acceleration and complicated parameter selection. To address the limitations of
existing CS-MRI methods, a model-driven MR reconstruction is proposed that
trains a deep network, named CP-net, which is derived from the Chambolle-Pock
algorithm to reconstruct the in vivo MR images of human brains from highly
undersampled complex k-space data acquired on different types of MR scanners.
The proposed deep network can learn the proximal operator and parameters among
the Chambolle-Pock algorithm. All of the experiments show that the proposed
CP-net achieves more accurate MR reconstruction results, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods across various quantitative metrics.","['Haifeng Wang', 'Jing Cheng', 'Sen Jia', 'Zhilang Qiu', 'Caiyun Shi', 'Lixian Zou', 'Shi Su', 'Yuchou Chang', 'Yanjie Zhu', 'Leslie Ying', 'Dong Liang']",2019-05-23T08:12:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09525v1

diagrammatic construction theory [Sokolov, A. Yu. J. Chem. Phys. 2018, 149,

intensities for many photoelectron transitions in a single computation. In
contrast to conventional MRPT2 methods, MR-ADC(2) provides information about
ionization of electrons in all orbitals (i.e., core and active) and allows to
compute transition intensities in straightforward and efficient way. Although
equations of MR-ADC(2) depend on four-particle reduced density matrices, we
demonstrate that computation of these large matrices can be completely avoided
without introducing any approximations. The resulting MR-ADC(2) implementation
has a lower computational scaling compared to conventional MRPT2 methods. We

Normalizing Compositional Structures Across Graphbanks,"The emergence of a variety of graph-based meaning representations (MRs) has
sparked an important conversation about how to adequately represent semantic
structure. These MRs exhibit structural differences that reflect different
theoretical and design considerations, presenting challenges to uniform
linguistic analysis and cross-framework semantic parsing. Here, we ask the
question of which design differences between MRs are meaningful and
semantically-rooted, and which are superficial. We present a methodology for
normalizing discrepancies between MRs at the compositional level (Lindemann et
al., 2019), finding that we can normalize the majority of divergent phenomena
using linguistically-grounded rules. Our work significantly increases the match
in compositional structure between MRs and improves multi-task learning (MTL)

Therefore, MRS complements existing cross-lingual generalization benchmarks

produces non-cyclic codes. Furthermore, we prove both necessary conditions and
sufficient conditions that specify when the known non-cyclic MR codes may be
permuted to become cyclic, thus proving our construction produces cyclic MR

relays (MRs) deployed on the roof of the train. The MRs operate in the
full-duplex (FD) mode to achieve high spectrum utilization. We formulate the
problem of minimizing the average task execution latency of all users, under
local device and MRs energy consumption constraints. We propose a joint
resource allocation and computation offloading scheme (JRACO) to solve the
problem. It consists of a resource allocation and computation offloading (RACO)
algorithm and an MR Energy constraint algorithm. RACO utilizes the matching
game theory to iterate between two subproblems, i.e., data segmentation and
user association and sub-channel allocation. With the RACO results, the MR
energy constraint algorithm ensures that the MR energy consumption constraint
is satisfied. Extensive simulations validate that JRACO can effectively reduce
the average latency and increase the number of served users compared with three

"Learning-based and unrolled motion-compensated reconstruction for
  cardiac MR CINE imaging","Motion-compensated MR reconstruction (MCMR) is a powerful concept with
considerable potential, consisting of two coupled sub-problems: Motion
estimation, assuming a known image, and image reconstruction, assuming known
motion. In this work, we propose a learning-based self-supervised framework for
MCMR, to efficiently deal with non-rigid motion corruption in cardiac MR
imaging. Contrary to conventional MCMR methods in which the motion is estimated
prior to reconstruction and remains unchanged during the iterative optimization
process, we introduce a dynamic motion estimation process and embed it into the
unrolled optimization. We establish a cardiac motion estimation network that
leverages temporal information via a group-wise registration approach, and
carry out a joint optimization between the motion estimation and
reconstruction. Experiments on 40 acquired 2D cardiac MR CINE datasets
demonstrate that the proposed unrolled MCMR framework can reconstruct high
quality MR images at high acceleration rates where other state-of-the-art
methods fail. We also show that the joint optimization mechanism is mutually
beneficial for both sub-tasks, i.e., motion estimation and image
reconstruction, especially when the MR image is highly undersampled.","['Jiazhen Pan', 'Daniel Rueckert', 'Thomas Küstner', 'Kerstin Hammernik']",2022-09-08T09:34:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03671v1
"A latent space for unsupervised MR image quality control via artifact

human effort to craft meaningful features or label large datasets for

biased, as labeling MR images based on their quality is a subjective task. In
this paper, we propose an automatic IQC method that evaluates the extent of
artifacts in MR images without supervision. In particular, we design an
artifact encoding network that learns representations of artifacts based on
contrastive learning. We then use a normalizing flow to estimate the density of
learned representations for unsupervised classification. Our experiments on
large-scale multi-cohort MR datasets show that the proposed method accurately
detects images with high levels of artifacts, which can inform downstream
analysis tasks about potentially flawed data.","['Lianrui Zuo', 'Yuan Xue', 'Blake E. Dewey', 'Yihao Liu', 'Jerry L. Prince', 'Aaron Carass']",2023-02-01T15:55:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00528v1

magnetoresistance (MR) study of a kagome material, Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$. Based on
analysis of the temperature, magnetic field, and field angle dependence of the

"Reduced steroid activation of elephant shark glucocorticoid and

that are identical except for a four amino acid insert (Thr-Arg-Gln-Gly) in the

response of lamprey CR1 to steroids. The DBD in elephant shark
mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which are
descended from a CR, lack these four amino acids, suggesting that a CR2 is
their common ancestor. To determine if, similar to lamprey CR1, the presence of
this insert in elephant shark MR and GR decreases transcriptional activation by
corticosteroids, we inserted these four CR1-specific residues into the DBD of
elephant shark MR and GR. Compared to steroid activation of wild-type elephant
shark MR and GR, cortisol, corticosterone, aldosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone

"An adaptive multiresolution flux reconstruction method with local time

(MR) techniques with the flux reconstruction (FR) method to accurately and
effciently simulate compressible flows. We achieve further enhancements in
effciency through the incorporation of local time stepping, and we add
artificial viscosity to capture shocks. With the developed MR-FR algorithm, the
layer difference of two adjacent elements can exceed 1, and simulation errors
can be adjusted by manipulating a single scalar. To ensure conservation,
information communication between nodes at different layers is accomplished
using L2 projection. Additionally, we propose an innovative indicator based on
MR analysis to detect discontinuities, enabling us to take full advantage of
the details generated by MR. By indicating smoothness and adding artificial
viscosity only to the finest meshes, computational costs can be reduced and
errors resulting from artificial diffusion can be locally limited. Numerical
tests demonstrate that the adoption of MR preserve the convergence order of the
FR method, and the newly proposed indicator performs well in detecting
discontinuities. Overall, the MR-FR algorithm can accurately simulate
compressible flows with strong shocks and physical dissipation using
significantly fewer grids, making it a promising approach for further
applications.","['Yixuan Lian', 'Jinsheng Cai', 'Shucheng Pan']",2023-06-20T09:03:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11396v1

"A Random Effects Model-based Method of Moments Estimation of Causal

genetic data to estimate the causal effect of an exposure factor on an outcome
from observational studies. In this paper, we utilize genetic correlations to
summarize information on a large set of genetic variants associated with the
exposure factor. Our proposed approach is a generalization of the MR-inverse
variance weighting (IVW) approach where we can accommodate many weak and
pleiotropic effects. Our approach quantifies the variation explained by all
valid instrumental variables (IVs) instead of estimating the individual effects
and thus could accommodate weak IVs. This is particularly useful for performing
MR estimation in small studies, or minority populations where the selection of
valid IVs is unreliable and thus has a large influence on the MR estimation.
Through simulation and real data analysis, we demonstrate that our approach
provides a robust alternative to the existing MR methods. We illustrate the
robustness of our proposed approach under the violation of MR assumptions and

investigate the potential synergy between TAD and MR. Firstly, we propose a
unified architecture, termed Unified Moment Detection (UniMD), for both TAD and
MR. It transforms the inputs of the two tasks, namely actions for TAD or events
for MR, into a common embedding space, and utilizes two novel query-dependent
decoders to generate a uniform output of classification score and temporal
segments. Secondly, we explore the efficacy of two task fusion learning
approaches, pre-training and co-training, in order to enhance the mutual
benefits between TAD and MR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed task fusion learning scheme enables the two tasks to help each other
and outperform the separately trained counterparts. Impressively, UniMD
achieves state-of-the-art results on three paired datasets Ego4D, Charades-STA,
and ActivityNet. Our code will be released at

"Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge Models for High-Quality MR-to-CT
  Synthesis for Head and Neck Proton Treatment Planning","In recent advancements in proton therapy, MR-based treatment planning is
gaining momentum to minimize additional radiation exposure compared to
traditional CT-based methods. This transition highlights the critical need for
accurate MR-to-CT image synthesis, which is essential for precise proton dose
calculations. Our research introduces the Diffusion Schr\""odinger Bridge Models
(DSBM), an innovative approach for high-quality MR-to-CT synthesis. DSBM learns
the nonlinear diffusion processes between MR and CT data distributions. This
method improves upon traditional diffusion models by initiating synthesis from
the prior distribution rather than the Gaussian distribution, enhancing both
generation quality and efficiency. We validated the effectiveness of DSBM on a
head and neck cancer dataset, demonstrating its superiority over traditional
image synthesis methods through both image-level and dosimetric-level
evaluations. The effectiveness of DSBM in MR-based proton treatment planning
highlights its potential as a valuable tool in various clinical scenarios.","['Muheng Li', 'Xia Li', 'Sairos Safai', 'Damien Weber', 'Antony Lomax', 'Ye Zhang']",2024-04-17T20:48:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11741v1
"Efficient Spin-Adapted Implementation of Multireference Algebraic
  Diagrammatic Construction Theory. I. Core-Ionized States and X-Ray
  Photoelectron Spectra","We present an efficient implementation of multireference algebraic
diagrammatic construction theory (MR-ADC) for simulating core-ionized states
and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). Taking advantage of spin adaptation,
automatic code generation, and density fitting, our implementation can perform
calculations for molecules with more than 1500 molecular orbitals,
incorporating static and dynamic correlation in the ground and excited
electronic states. We demonstrate the capabilities of MR-ADC methods by
simulating the XPS spectra of substituted ferrocene complexes and azobenzene
isomers. For the ground electronic states of these molecules, the XPS spectra
computed using the extended second-order MR-ADC method (MR-ADC(2)-X) are in
excellent agreement with available experimental results. We further show that
MR-ADC can be used as a tool for interpreting or predicting the results of
time-resolved XPS measurements by simulating the core ionization spectra of
azobenzene along its photoisomerization, including the XPS signatures of
excited states and the minimum energy conical intersection. This work is the
first in a series of publications reporting the efficient implementations of
MR-ADC methods.","['Carlos E. V. de Moura', 'Alexander Yu. Sokolov']",2024-05-13T20:05:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08161v1
"Opening a new window on MR-based Electrical Properties Tomography with
  deep learning","Electrical properties (EPs) of tissues, conductivity and permittivity, are
modulated by the ionic and water content, which change in presence of
pathologies. Information on tissues EPs can be used e.g. as an endogenous
biomarker in oncology. MR-Electrical Properties Tomography (MR-EPT) aims to
reconstruct tissue EPs by solving an electromagnetic inverse problem relating
MR measurements of the transmit radiofrequency RF field to the EPs. However,
MR-EPT reconstructions highly suffer from noise in the RF field maps, which
limits the clinical applicability. Instead of employing electromagnetic models
posing strict requirements on the measured quantities, we propose a data driven
approach where the inverse transformation is learned by means of a neural
network. Supervised training of a conditional generative adversarial neural
network was performed using simulated realistic RF field maps and realistic
human head dielectric models. Deep learning EPT (DL-EPT) reconstructions are
presented for in-silica MR data and MR measurements at 3 Tesla on phantoms and
human brains. DL-EPT shows high quality EP maps, demonstrating good accuracy
and greatly improved precision compared to conventional MR-EPT. Moreover,
DL-EPT allows permittivity reconstructions at 3 Tesla, which is not possible
with state-of-art MR-EPT techniques. The supervised learning-based approach
leverages the strength of tailored electromagnetic simulations, allowing
inclusion of a priori information (e.g. coil setup) and circumvention of
inaccessible MR electromagnetic quantities. Since DL-EPT is highly
noise-robust, the requirements for MRI data acquisitions can be relaxed,
allowing faster acquisitions and higher resolutions. We believe that DL-EPT
greatly improves the quality and applicability of EPT opening a new window for
an endogenous biomarker in MRI diagnostics that reflects differences in ionic
tissue content.","['Stefano Mandija', 'Ettore F. Meliadò', 'Niek R. F. Huttinga', 'Peter R. Luijten', 'Cornelis A. T. van den Berg']",2018-03-30T18:10:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00016v2
"The impact of MR-guided attenuation correction (compared to CTbased AC)
  on the diagnosis of anosmia based on 99m-Tc EthylCysteinate-Dimer SPECT
  images","99m-Tc Ethyl-Cysteinate-Dimer SPECT and MR imaging play a significant role in
diagnosing anosmia. In this study, two-tissue class and three-tissue class
attenuation maps (2C-MR and 3CMR) obtained from MR images were compared with
CT-based attenuation correction (CTAC). Afterward, the presence of
hypo-perfusion in brain lobes was evaluated in SPECT images. The 2C-MRAC map
was generated through segmentation of T1-W MR images into air and soft-tissue,
while in the 3C-MRAC map, the cortical bone was also considered. For
investigating MRAC approaches, the difference between activity concentration
(ACC) values was estimated in 144 volumes of interest. Ten normal and fourteen
anosmic patients were compared by calculating the average normalized count and
standard uptake value ratio parameters in the brain lobes. The comparison
between attenuation correction strategies represented that MRAC images resulted
in underestimation of the ACC values which was more substantial in the cortical
area rather than in central regions (maximum 9% vs. 6% for 2C-MR and maximum
5.5% vs. 3.5% for 3C-MR). Nevertheless, there was a strong correlation between
the MRAC and CTAC methods with a correlation coefficient of 0.7 for both 2C-MR
and 3C-MR. The statistical analysis between normal and affected groups
indicated the hypoperfusion in the cortex of Lh_frontal, Rh and Lh_temporal
lobes with p-values < 0.05. Using MRAC resulted in underestimation of activity
concentration which was partly eliminated by considering the cortical bone in
the 3C-MR attenuation map. Hypo-perfusion was perceived in Frontal and Temporal
lobes in SPECT-MRAC images of the anosmic group.","['Faeze Gholamiankhah', 'Samaneh Mostafapour', 'Seid Kazem Razavi-Ratki', 'Ali Asghar Parach', 'Hossein Arabi']",2021-06-07T15:22:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03712v1
"Geometric distortion and astrometric calibration of the JWST MIRI Medium
  Resolution Spectrometer","The Medium-Resolution integral field Spectrometer (MRS) of MIRI on board JWST
performs spectroscopy between 5 and 28~$\mu$m. The optics of the MRS introduce
substantial distortion, and this needs to be rectified in order to reconstruct
the observed astrophysical scene. We use data from the JWST/MIRI commissioning
and cycle 1 calibration phase, to derive the MRS geometric distortion and
astrometric solution, a critical step in the calibration of MRS data. These
solutions come in the form of transform matrices that map the detector pixels
to spatial coordinates of a local MRS coordinate system called
$\alpha$/$\beta$, to the global JWST observatory coordinates V2/V3. For every
MRS spectral band and each slice dispersed on the detector, the transform of
detector pixels to $\alpha$/$\beta$ is fit by a two-dimensional polynomial,
using a raster of point source observations. A polynomial transform is used to
map the coordinates from $\alpha$/$\beta$ to V2/V3. We calibrated the
distortion of all 198 discrete slices of the MIRI/MRS IFUs, and derived an
updated Field of View (FoV) for each MRS spectral band. The precision of the
distortion solution is estimated to be better than one tenth of a spatial
resolution element, with a root mean square (rms) of 10 milli-arcsecond (mas)
at 5 $\mu$m, to 23 mas at 27 $\mu$m. Finally we find that the wheel positioning
repeatability causes an additional astrometric error of rms 30 mas. We have
demonstrated the MRS astrometric calibration strategy and analysis enabling the
calibration of MRS spectra, a critical step in the data pipeline especially for
science with spatially resolved objects. The distortion calibration was folded
into the JWST pipeline in Calibration Reference Data System (CRDS) context
jwst\_1094.pmap. The distortion calibration precision meets the pre-launch
requirement, and the estimated total astrometric uncertainty is 50 mas.","['P. Patapis', 'I. Argyriou', 'D. R. Law', 'A. M. Glauser', 'A. Glasse', 'A. Labiano', 'J. Álvarez-Márquez', 'P. J.

"Spin reorientation and in-plane magnetoresistance of lightly doped
  La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} in magnetic fields up to 55 T","The magnetoresistance (MR) in the in-plane resistivity is measured in
magnetic fields up to 55 T in lightly doped La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4} in the N\'eel
state (x = 0.01) and in the spin-glass state (x = 0.03) using high-quality
untwinned single crystals. In both cases, a large negative MR is observed to
appear when the magnetic order is established. For x = 0.01, it is found that
the MR is indicative of a one-step transition into a high-field
weak-ferromagnetic state at around 20 T when the magnetic field is applied from
the spin easy axis (b axis), which means that there is no spin-flop transition
in the N\'eel state of this material; this is contrary to a previous report,
but is natural in light of the peculiar in-plane magnetic susceptibility
anisotropy recently found in this system. In the spin-glass state, we observe
that the large (up to \sim20%) negative MR saturates at around 40 T, and this
MR is found to be essentially isotropic when the magnetic field is rotated
within the ab plane. Our data show that the large negative MR is inherent to
LSCO in a magnetically ordered state, in which the weak-ferromagnetic (WF)
moment becomes well-defined; we discuss that the observed MR is essentially due
to the reorientation of the WF moments towards the magnetic field direction

"Magnetoresistance Effects in SrFeO(3-x): Dependence on Phase Composition
  and Relation to Magnetic and Charge Order","Single crystals of iron(IV) rich oxides SrFeO(3-x) with controlled oxygen
content have been studied by Moessbauer spectroscopy, magnetometry,
magnetotransport measurements, Raman spectroscopy, and infrared ellipsometry in
order to relate the large magnetoresistance (MR) effects in this system to
phase composition, magnetic and charge order. It is shown that three different
types of MR effects occur. In cubic SrFeO3 (x = 0) a large negative MR of 25%
at 9 T is associated with a hitherto unknown 60 K magnetic transition and a
subsequent drop in resistivity. The 60 K transition appears in addition to the
onset of helical ordering at ~130 K. In crystals with vacancy-ordered
tetragonal SrFeO(3-x) as majority phase (x ~0.15) a coincident
charge/antiferromagnetic ordering transition near 70 K gives rise to a negative
giant MR effect of 90% at 9 T. A positive MR effect is observed in tetragonal
and orthorhombic materials with increased oxygen deficiency (x = 0.19, 0.23)
which are insulating at low temperatures. Phase mixtures can result in a
complex superposition of these different MR phenomena. The MR effects in
SrFeO(3-x) differ from those in manganites as no ferromagnetic states are
involved.","['P. Adler', 'A. Lebon', 'V. Damljanovic', 'C. Ulrich', 'C. Bernhard', 'A. V. Boris', 'A. Maljuk', 'C. T. Lin', 'B. Keimer']",2005-12-20T15:56:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0512510v1
Point-contact search for antiferromagnetic giant magnetoresistance,"We report the first measurements of effects of large current densities on
current-perpendicular-to-plane magnetoresistance (MR) of magnetic multilayers
containing two antiferromagnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic layer.
These measurements were intended to search for a recently predicted
antiferromagnetic giant magnetoresistance (AGMR) similar to GMR seen in
multilayers containing two ferromagnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic
layer. We report on MR measurements for current injected from point contacts
into sandwiches containing different combinations of layers of F = CoFe and AFM
= FeMn. In addition to: AFM/N/AFM, F/AFM/N/AFM, and F/AFM/N/AFM/F structures,
initial results led us to examine also AFM/F/N/AFM, F/AFM, and single F- and
AFM-layer structures. At low currents, no MR was observed in any samples, and
no MR was observed at any current densities in samples containing only AFMs.
Together, these results indicate that no AGMR is present in these samples. In
samples containing F-layers, high current densities sometimes produced a small
positive MR - largest resistance at high fields. For a given contact
resistance, this MR was usually larger for thicker F-layers, and for a given
current, it was usually larger for larger contact resistances (smaller
contacts). We tentatively attribute this positive MR to suppression at high
currents of spin accumulation induced around and within the F-layers.","['Z. Wei', 'A. Sharma', 'J. Bass', 'M. Tsoi']",2007-11-01T04:18:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.0059v3
"Magnetoresistance behavior of a ferromagnetic shape memory alloy:
  Ni_1.75Mn_1.25Ga","A negative-positive-negative switching behavior of magnetoresistance (MR)
with temperature is observed in a ferromagnetic shape memory alloy
Ni_1.75Mn_1.25Ga. In the austenitic phase between 300 and 120 K, MR is negative
due to s-d scattering. Curiously, below 120K MR is positive, while at still
lower temperatures in the martensitic phase, MR is negative again. The positive
MR cannot be explained by Lorentz contribution and is related to a magnetic
transition. Evidence for this is obtained from ab initio density functional
theory, a decrease in magnetization and resistivity upturn at 120 K. Theory
shows that a ferrimagnetic state with anti-ferromagnetic alignment between the
local magnetic moments of the Mn atoms is the energetically favoured ground
state. In the martensitic phase, there are two competing factors that govern
the MR behavior: a dominant negative trend up to the saturation field due to
the decrease of electron scattering at twin and domain boundaries; and a weaker
positive trend due to the ferrimagnetic nature of the magnetic state. MR
exhibits a hysteresis between heating and cooling that is related to the first
order nature of the martensitic phase transition.","['S. Banik', 'R. Rawat', 'P. K. Mukhopadhyay', 'B. L. Ahuja', 'Aparna Chakrabarti', 'P. L. Paulose', 'S. Singh', 'A. K. Singh', 'D. Pandey', 'S. R. Barman']",2008-02-13T11:07:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1801v2
"Minimal Protocol for MRS Quality Control and Acceptance Test for
  Philips-Achieva MRS Tool","Difficulties in obtaining good phantoms, improvements in technologies of
voxel localization, better sequences for water and fat suppression has brought
us to define a minimal Protocol of home-made quality controls of MRS systems.
Measurements, defined in the proposed protocol, have, as main goal, to
establish if peaks quantification predicts realistic concentration values,
meaning that, the occurrence of this event is a sufficient condition to declare
that MRS system works good. Moreover, stability measurements helps in a correct
data understanding. It is, indeed, realistic to think that environmental
condition can introduce casual errors in the working good system. Discrepancies
in the working good condition, under stochastic variability (environment), have
to be related to systematic errors introduced by the set of pre and/or
post-processing operations and/or by any forms of MRS bad-working tool that
differs from the previous. The quality control minimal protocol has been
executed on a Philips-Achieva MRS system utilizing a phantom supplied by the
manufacturer. The minimal protocol consists of two steps: reproducibility and
performance tests. The reproducibility of the MRS measurements helps in
quantifying the stability of the system. The performance test enables to
establish if the system is able to reproduce concentrations in a realistic way.

"Magnetoresistive effect in graphene nanoribbon due to magnetic field
  induced band gap modulation","The electronic properties of armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) can be
significantly modified from semiconducting to metallic states, by applying a
uniform perpendicular magnetic field (B-field). Here, we theoretically study
the bandgap modulation induced by a perpendicular B-field. The applied B-field
causes the lowest conduction subband and the top-most valence subband to move
closer to one another to form the n=0 Landau level. We exploit this effect to
realize a device relevant MR modulation. Unlike in conventional spin-valves,
this intrinsic MR effect is realized without the use of any ferromagnetic
leads. The AGNRs with number of dimers, Na=3p+1 [p=1,2,3,...] show the most
promising behavior for MR applications, with large conductance modulation and
hence, high MR ratio at the optimal source-drain bias. However, the MR is
suppressed at higher temperature due to the spread of the Fermi function
distribution. We also investigate the importance of the source-drain bias in
optimizing the MR. Lastly, we show that edge roughness of AGNRs has the
unexpected effect of improving the magnetic sensitivity of the device and thus
increasing the MR ratio.","['S. Bala Kumar', 'M. B. A. Jalil', 'S. G. Tan', 'Gengchiau Liang']",2010-06-11T08:51:41Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2235v2
Strong magnetoresistance of disordered graphene,"We study theoretically magnetoresistance (MR) of graphene with different
types of disorder. For short-range disorder, the key parameter determining
magnetotransport properties---a product of the cyclotron frequency and
scattering time---depends in graphene not only on magnetic field $H$ but also
on the electron energy $\varepsilon$. As a result, a strong, square-root in
$H$, MR arises already within the Drude-Boltzmann approach. The MR is
particularly pronounced near the Dirac point. Furthermore, for the same reason,
""quantum"" (separated Landau levels) and ""classical"" (overlapping Landau levels)
regimes may coexist in the same sample at fixed $H.$ We calculate the
conductivity tensor within the self-consistent Born approximation for the case
of relatively high temperature, when Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are
suppressed by thermal averaging. We predict a square-root MR both at very low
and at very high $H:$ $[\varrho_{xx}(H)-\varrho_{xx}(0)]/\varrho_{xx}(0)\approx
C \sqrt{H},$ where $C$ is a temperature-dependent factor, different in the low-
and strong-field limits and containing both ""quantum"" and ""classical""
contributions. We also find a nonmonotonic dependence of the Hall coefficient
both on magnetic field and on the electron concentration. In the case of
screened charged impurities, we predict a strong temperature-independent MR
near the Dirac point. Further, we discuss the competition between disorder- and
collision-dominated mechanisms of the MR. In particular, we find that the
square-root MR is always established for graphene with charged impurities in a
generic gated setup at low temperature.","['P. S. Alekseev', 'A. P. Dmitriev', 'I. V. Gornyi', 'V. Yu. Kachorovskii']",2012-10-22T22:50:35Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6081v2
"Accessing Different Spin-Disordered States using First Order Reversal
  Curves","Combined first order reversal curve (FORC) analyses of the magnetization
(M-FORC) and magnetoresistance (MR-FORC) have been employed to provide a
comprehensive study of the M-MR correlation in two canonical systems: a
NiFe/Cu/FePt pseudo spin-valve (PSV) and a [Co/Cu]8 multilayer. In the PSV, due
to the large difference in switching fields and minimal interactions between
the NiFe and FePt layers, the M and MR show a simple one-to-one relationship
during reversal. In the [Co/Cu]8 multilayer, the correlation between the
magnetization reversal and MR evolution is more complex. This is primarily due
to the similar switching fields of, and interactions between, the constituent
Co layers. The FORC protocol accesses states with much higher spin disorders
and larger MR than those found along the conventional major loop field-cycle.
Unlike the M-FORC measurements, which only probe changes in the macroscopic
magnetization, the MR-FORCs are more sensitive to the microscopic domain
configurations, as those are most important in determining the resultant MR
effect size. This approach is generally applicable to spintronic systems to
realize the maximum spin-disorder and the largest MR.","['Randy K. Dumas', 'Peter K. Greene', 'Dustin A. Gilbert', 'Li Ye', 'Chaolin Zha', 'Johan Åkerman', 'Kai Liu']",2014-09-02T19:03:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0825v1

noise ratio compared to MR. In this work, we investigate whether a conditional
mapping can be learned by a generative adversarial network to map CTP inputs to
generated MR DWI that more clearly delineates hyperintense regions due to
ischemic stroke. We detail the architectures of the generator and discriminator
and describe the training process used to perform image-to-image translation
from multi-modal CT perfusion maps to diffusion weighted MR outputs. We
evaluate the results both qualitatively by visual comparison of generated MR to
ground truth, as well as quantitatively by training fully convolutional neural

"MMS Observations of Whistler and Lower Hybrid Drift Waves Associated
  with Magnetic Reconnection in the Turbulent Magnetosheath","Magnetic reconnection (MR) and the associated concurrently occurring waves

quasi-symmetric and asymmetric configurations in the terrestrial magnetotail

magnetosheath where the conditions are highly turbulent when the upstream shock
geometry is quasi-parallel. The strong turbulent motions make the boundary
conditions for evolving MR complicated. In this paper it is demonstrated that
the wave observations in localized regions of MR can serve as an additional
diagnostic tool reinforcing our capacity for identifying MR events in turbulent
plasmas. It is shown that in a close resemblance with MR at large-scale
boundaries, turbulent reconnection associated whistler waves occur at
separatrix/outflow regions and at the outer boundary of the electron diffusion
region, while lower hybrid drift waves are associated with density gradients
during the crossing of the current sheet. The lower hybrid drift instability
can make the density inhomogeneities rippled. The identification of MR

Resistance versus temperature of the most resistive bilayers shows insulating

normal to the wafer (MR=[R(H)-R(0)]/\{[R(H)+R(0)]/2\}), and under three
electric gate-fields of 0 and $\pm2$ MV/cm. The MR results showed a complex set

discussed in terms of vortex physics, and the origin of the different MR peaks

the different proximity regions in the $\rm Bi_2Se_3$ cap-layer. The dominant

"Magnetoresistence engineering and singlet/triplet switching in InAs
  nanowire quantum dots with ferromagnetic sidegates","We present magnetoresistance (MR) experiments on an InAs nanowire quantum dot
device with two ferromagnetic sidegates (FSGs) in a split-gate geometry. The
wire segment can be electrically tuned to a single dot or to a double dot
regime using the FSGs and a backgate. In both regimes we find a strong MR and a
sharp MR switching of up to 25\% at the field at which the magnetizations of
the FSGs are inverted by the external field. The sign and amplitude of the MR
and the MR switching can both be tuned electrically by the FSGs. In a double
dot regime close to pinch-off we find {\it two} sharp transitions in the
conductance, reminiscent of tunneling MR (TMR) between two ferromagnetic
contacts, with one transition near zero and one at the FSG switching fields.
These surprisingly rich characteristics we explain in several simple resonant
tunneling models. For example, the TMR-like MR can be understood as a
stray-field controlled transition between singlet and a triplet double dot
states. Such local magnetic fields are the key elements in various proposals to
engineer novel states of matter and may be used for testing electron spin-based
Bell inequalities.","['G. Fábián', 'P. Makk', 'M. H. Madsen', 'J. Nygård', 'C. Schönenberger', 'A. Baumgartner']",2016-08-25T13:46:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07143v1

"Deep Learning based Inter-Modality Image Registration Supervised by
  Intra-Modality Similarity","Non-rigid inter-modality registration can facilitate accurate information
fusion from different modalities, but it is challenging due to the very
different image appearances across modalities. In this paper, we propose to
train a non-rigid inter-modality image registration network, which can directly
predict the transformation field from the input multimodal images, such as CT
and MR images. In particular, the training of our inter-modality registration
network is supervised by intra-modality similarity metric based on the
available paired data, which is derived from a pre-aligned CT and MR dataset.
Specifically, in the training stage, to register the input CT and MR images,
their similarity is evaluated on the warped MR image and the MR image that is
paired with the input CT. So that, the intra-modality similarity metric can be
directly applied to measure whether the input CT and MR images are well
registered. Moreover, we use the idea of dual-modality fashion, in which we
measure the similarity on both CT modality and MR modality. In this way, the
complementary anatomies in both modalities can be jointly considered to more
accurately train the inter-modality registration network. In the testing stage,
the trained inter-modality registration network can be directly applied to
register the new multimodal images without any paired data. Experimental
results have shown that, the proposed method can achieve promising accuracy and
efficiency for the challenging non-rigid inter-modality registration task and
also outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.","['Xiaohuan Cao', 'Jianhua Yang', 'Li Wang', 'Zhong Xue', 'Qian Wang', 'Dinggang Shen']",2018-04-28T03:53:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10735v1
"Energy balancing for robotic aided clustered wireless sensor networks
  using mobility diversity algorithms","We consider the problem of energy balancing in a clustered wireless sensor
network (WSN) deployed randomly in a large field and aided by a mobile robot
(MR). The sensor nodes (SNs) are tasked to monitor a region of interest (ROI)
and report their test statistics to the cluster heads (CHs), which subsequently
report to the fusion center (FC) over a wireless fading channel. To maximize
the lifetime of the WSN, the MR is deployed to act as an adaptive relay between
a subset of the CHs and the FC. To achieve this we develop a multiple-link
mobility diversity algorithm (MDA) executed by the MR that will allow to
compensate simultaneously for the small-scale fading at the established
wireless links (i.e., the MR-to-FC as well as various CH-to-MR communication
links). Simulation results show that the proposed MR aided technique is able to
significantly reduce the transmission power required and thus extend the
operational lifetime of the WSN. We also show how the effect of small-scale
fading at various wireless links is mitigated by using the proposed
multiple-link MDA executed by a MR equipped with a single antenna.","['Daniel Bonilla Licea', 'Edmond Nurellari', 'Mounir Ghogho']",2018-05-21T12:56:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08025v2
"Direct evidence for charge compensation induced large magnetoresistance
  in thin WTe2","Since the discovery of extremely large non-saturating magnetoresistance (MR)
in WTe2, much effort has been devoted to understanding the underlying
mechanism, which is still under debate. Here, we explicitly identify the
dominant physical origin of the large non-saturating MR through in-situ tuning
of the magneto-transport properties in thin WTe2 film. With an electrostatic
doping approach, we observed a non-monotonic gate dependence of the MR. The MR
reaches a maximum (10600%) in thin WTe2 film at certain gate voltage where
electron and hole concentrations are balanced, indicating that the charge
compensation is the dominant mechanism of the observed large MR. Besides, we
show that the temperature dependent magnetoresistance exhibits similar tendency
with the carrier mobility when the charge compensation is retained, revealing
that distinct scattering mechanisms may be at play for the temperature
dependence of magneto-transport properties. Our work would be helpful for
understanding mechanism of the large MR in other nonmagnetic materials and
offers an avenue for achieving large MR in the non-magnetic materials with
electron-hole pockets.","['Yaojia Wang', 'Lizheng Wang', 'Xiaowei Liu', 'Heng Wu', 'Pengfei Wang', 'Dayu Yan', 'Bin Cheng', 'Youguo Shi', 'Kenji Watanabe', 'Takashi Taniguchi', 'Shi-Jun Liang', 'Feng Miao']",2019-05-14T02:43:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05364v1

"Histology to 3D In Vivo MR Registration for Volumetric Evaluation of
  MRgFUS Treatment Assessment Biomarkers","Advances in imaging and early cancer detection have increased interest in
magnetic resonance (MR) guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) technologies for
cancer treatment. MRgFUS ablation treatments could reduce surgical risks,
preserve organ tissue/function, and improve patient quality of life. However,
surgical resection and histological analysis remain the gold standard to assess
cancer treatment response. For non-invasive ablation therapies such as MRgFUS,
the treatment response must be determined through MR imaging biomarkers.
However, current MR biomarkers are inconclusive and have not been rigorously
evaluated against histology via accurate registration. Existing registration
methods rely on anatomical features to directly register in vivo MR and
histology. For MRgFUS applications in anatomies such as liver, kidney, or
breast, anatomical features independent from treatment features are often
insufficient to perform direct registration. We present a novel MR to histology
registration workflow that utilizes intermediate imaging and does not rely on
these independent features. The presented workflow yields an overall
registration accuracy of 1.00 +/- 0.13 mm. The developed registration pipeline
is used to evaluate a common MRgFUS treatment assessment biomarker against
histology. Evaluating MR biomarkers against histology using this registration
pipeline will facilitate validating novel MRgFUS biomarkers to improve
treatment assessment without surgical intervention.","['Blake E. Zimmerman', 'Sara L. Johnson', 'Henrik A. Odéen', 'Jill E. Shea', 'Rachel E. Factor', 'Sarang C. Joshi', 'Allison H. Payne']",2020-11-21T02:40:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10708v1
"Room-temperature colossal magnetoresistance in terraced single-layer
  graphene","Disorder-induced magnetoresistance (MR) effect is quadratic at low
perpendicular magnetic fields and linear at high fields. This effect is
technologically appealing, especially in the two-dimensional (2D) materials
such as graphene, since it offers potential applications in magnetic sensors
with nanoscale spatial resolution. However, it is a great challenge to realize
a graphene magnetic sensor based on this effect because of the difficulty in
controlling the spatial distribution of disorder and enhancing the MR
sensitivity in the single-layer regime. Here, we report a room-temperature
colossal MR of up to 5,000% at 9 T in terraced single-layer graphene. By
laminating single-layer graphene on a terraced substrate, such as TiO2
terminated SrTiO3, we demonstrate a universal one order of magnitude
enhancement in the MR compared to conventional single-layer graphene devices.
Strikingly, a colossal MR of >1,000% was also achieved in the terraced graphene
even at a high carrier density of ~1012 cm-2. Systematic studies of the MR of
single-layer graphene on various oxide- and non-oxide-based terraced surfaces
demonstrate that the terraced structure is the dominant factor driving the MR
enhancement. Our results open a new route for tailoring the physical property
of 2D materials by engineering the strain through a terraced substrate.","['J. X. Hu', 'J. Gou', 'M. Yang', 'G. J. Omar', 'J. Y. Tan', 'S. W. Zeng', 'Y. P. Liu', 'K. Han', 'Z. S. Lim', 'Z. Huang', 'A. T. S. Wee', 'A. Ariando']",2021-01-19T12:51:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07595v1
"Fast matrix-free methods for model-based personalized synthetic MR
  imaging","Synthetic Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging predicts images at new design
parameter settings from a few observed MR scans. Model-based methods, that use
both the physical and statistical properties underlying the MR signal and its
acquisition, can predict images at any setting from as few as three scans,
allowing it to be used in individualized patient- and anatomy-specific
contexts. However, the estimation problem in model-based synthetic MR imaging
is ill-posed and so regularization, in the form of correlated Gaussian Markov
Random Fields, is imposed on the voxel-wise spin-lattice relaxation time,
spin-spin relaxation time and the proton density underlying the MR image. We
develop theoretically sound but computationally practical matrix-free
estimation methods for synthetic MR imaging. Our evaluations demonstrate
superior performance of our methods in currently-used clinical settings when
compared to existing model-based and deep learning methods. Moreover, unlike
deep learning approaches, our fast methodology can synthesize needed images
during patient visits, with good estimation and prediction accuracy and
consistency. An added strength of our model-based approach, also developed and
illustrated here, is the accurate estimation of standard errors of regional
contrasts in the synthesized images. A R package $symr$ implements our

"Information-based Disentangled Representation Learning for Unsupervised
  MR Harmonization","Accuracy and consistency are two key factors in computer-assisted magnetic
resonance (MR) image analysis. However, contrast variation from site to site
caused by lack of standardization in MR acquisition impedes consistent
measurements. In recent years, image harmonization approaches have been
proposed to compensate for contrast variation in MR images. Current
harmonization approaches either require cross-site traveling subjects for
supervised training or heavily rely on site-specific harmonization models to
encourage harmonization accuracy. These requirements potentially limit the
application of current harmonization methods in large-scale multi-site studies.
In this work, we propose an unsupervised MR harmonization framework, CALAMITI
(Contrast Anatomy Learning and Analysis for MR Intensity Translation and
Integration), based on information bottleneck theory. CALAMITI learns a
disentangled latent space using a unified structure for multi-site
harmonization without the need for traveling subjects. Our model is also able
to adapt itself to harmonize MR images from a new site with fine tuning solely
on images from the new site. Both qualitative and quantitative results show
that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared with other
unsupervised harmonization approaches.","['Lianrui Zuo', 'Blake E. Dewey', 'Aaron Carass', 'Yihao Liu', 'Yufan He', 'Peter A. Calabresi', 'Jerry L. Prince']",2021-03-24T15:54:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13283v1
"Use of Metamorphic Relations as Knowledge Carriers to Train Deep Neural
  Networks","Training multiple-layered deep neural networks (DNNs) is difficult. The
standard practice of using a large number of samples for training often does
not improve the performance of a DNN to a satisfactory level. Thus, a
systematic training approach is needed. To address this need, we introduce an
innovative approach of using metamorphic relations (MRs) as ""knowledge
carriers"" to train DNNs. Based on the concept of metamorphic testing and MRs
(which play the role of a test oracle in software testing), we make use of the
notion of metamorphic group of inputs as concrete instances of MRs (which are
abstractions of knowledge) to train a DNN in a systematic and effective manner.
To verify the viability of our training approach, we have conducted a
preliminary experiment to compare the performance of two DNNs: one trained with
MRs and the other trained without MRs. We found that the DNN trained with MRs
has delivered a better performance, thereby confirming that our approach of
using MRs as knowledge carriers to train DNNs is promising. More work and
studies, however, are needed to solidify and leverage this approach to generate
widespread impact on effective DNN training.","['Tsong Yueh Chen', 'Pak-Lok Poon', 'Kun Qiu', 'Zheng Zheng', 'Jinyi Zhou']",2021-04-10T09:15:17Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04718v2
"Sign reversal of magnetoresistivity in massive nodal-line semimetals due
  to Lifshitz transition of Fermi surface","Topological nodal-line semimetals offer an interesting research platform to
explore novel phenomena associated with its torus-shaped Fermi surface. Here,
we study magnetotransport in the massive nodal-line semimetal with spin-orbit
coupling and finite Berry curvature distribution which exists in many
candidates. The magnetic field leads to a deformation of the Fermi torus
through its coupling to the orbital magnetic moment, which turns out to be the
main scenario of the magnetoresistivity (MR) induced by the Berry curvature
effect. We show that a small deformation of the Fermi surface yields a positive
MR $\propto B^2$, different from the negative MR by pure Berry curvature effect
in other topological systems. As the magnetic field increases to a critical
value, a topological Lifshitz transition of the Fermi surface can be induced,
and the MR inverts its sign at the same time. The temperature dependence of the
MR is investigated, which shows a totally different behavior before and after
the Lifshitz transition. Our work uncovers a novel scenario of the MR induced
solely by the deformation of the Fermi surface and establishes a relation
between the Fermi surface topology and the sign of the MR.","['Min-Xue Yang', 'Hao Geng', 'Wei Luo', 'Li Sheng', 'Wei Chen', 'D. Y. Xing']",2021-08-05T01:58:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02338v1

was elicited through a questionnaire. The results of subsequent data analysis

"Exploiting Ligand Additivity for Transferable Machine Learning of
  Multireference Character Across Known Transition Metal Complex Ligands","Accurate virtual high-throughput screening (VHTS) of transition metal
complexes (TMCs) remains challenging due to the possibility of high
multi-reference (MR) character that complicates property evaluation. We compute
MR diagnostics for over 5,000 ligands present in previously synthesized
transition metal complexes in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). To
accomplish this task, we introduce an iterative approach for consistent ligand
charge assignment for ligands in the CSD. Across this set, we observe that MR
character correlates linearly with the inverse value of the averaged bond order
over all bonds in the molecule. We then demonstrate that ligand additivity of
MR character holds in TMCs, which suggests that the TMC MR character can be
inferred from the sum of the MR character of the ligands. Encouraged by this
observation, we leverage ligand additivity and develop a ligand-derived machine
learning representation to train neural networks to predict the MR character of
TMCs from properties of the constituent ligands. This approach yields models
with excellent performance and superior transferability to unseen ligand

"Spatial Attention-based Implicit Neural Representation for Arbitrary
  Reduction of MRI Slice Spacing","Magnetic resonance (MR) images collected in 2D clinical protocols typically
have large inter-slice spacing, resulting in high in-plane resolution and
reduced through-plane resolution. Super-resolution technique can enhance the
through-plane resolution of MR images to facilitate downstream visualization
and computer-aided diagnosis. However, most existing works train the
super-resolution network at a fixed scaling factor, which is not friendly to
clinical scenes of varying inter-slice spacing in MR scanning. Inspired by the
recent progress in implicit neural representation, we propose a Spatial
Attention-based Implicit Neural Representation (SA-INR) network for arbitrary
reduction of MR inter-slice spacing. The SA-INR aims to represent an MR image
as a continuous implicit function of 3D coordinates. In this way, the SA-INR
can reconstruct the MR image with arbitrary inter-slice spacing by continuously
sampling the coordinates in 3D space. In particular, a local-aware spatial
attention operation is introduced to model nearby voxels and their affinity
more accurately in a larger receptive field. Meanwhile, to improve the
computational efficiency, a gradient-guided gating mask is proposed for
applying the local-aware spatial attention to selected areas only. We evaluate
our method on the public HCP-1200 dataset and the clinical knee MR dataset to
demonstrate its superiority over other existing methods.","['Xin Wang', 'Sheng Wang', 'Honglin Xiong', 'Kai Xuan', 'Zixu Zhuang', 'Mengjun Liu', 'Zhenrong Shen', 'Xiangyu Zhao', 'Lichi Zhang', 'Qian Wang']",2022-05-23T14:36:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11346v2
"Self-supervised arbitrary scale super-resolution framework for
  anisotropic MRI","In this paper, we propose an efficient self-supervised arbitrary-scale
super-resolution (SR) framework to reconstruct isotropic magnetic resonance
(MR) images from anisotropic MRI inputs without involving external training
data. The proposed framework builds a training dataset using in-the-wild
anisotropic MR volumes with arbitrary image resolution. We then formulate the
3D volume SR task as a SR problem for 2D image slices. The anisotropic volume's
high-resolution (HR) plane is used to build the HR-LR image pairs for model
training. We further adapt the implicit neural representation (INR) network to
implement the 2D arbitrary-scale image SR model. Finally, we leverage the
well-trained proposed model to up-sample the 2D LR plane extracted from the
anisotropic MR volumes to their HR views. The isotropic MR volumes thus can be
reconstructed by stacking and averaging the generated HR slices. Our proposed
framework has two major advantages: (1) It only involves the
arbitrary-resolution anisotropic MR volumes, which greatly improves the model
practicality in real MR imaging scenarios (e.g., clinical brain image
acquisition); (2) The INR-based SR model enables arbitrary-scale image SR from
the arbitrary-resolution input image, which significantly improves model
training efficiency. We perform experiments on a simulated public adult brain
dataset and a real collected 7T brain dataset. The results indicate that our
current framework greatly outperforms two well-known self-supervised models for
anisotropic MR image SR tasks.","['Haonan Zhang', 'Yuhan Zhang', 'Qing Wu', 'Jiangjie Wu', 'Zhiming Zhen', 'Feng Shi', 'Jianmin Yuan', 'Hongjiang Wei', 'Chen Liu', 'Yuyao Zhang']",2023-05-02T12:27:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01360v1

  multi-parametric quantitative MRI","Magnetic Resonance Spin Tomography in Time-Domain (MR-STAT) is a
multiparametric quantitative MR framework, which allows for simultaneously
acquiring quantitative tissue parameters such as T1, T2 and proton density from
one single short scan. A typical 2D MR-STAT acquisition uses a
gradient-spoiled, gradient-echo sequence with a slowly varying RF flip-angle
train and Cartesian readouts, and the quantitative tissue maps are
reconstructed by an iterative, model-based optimization algorithm. In this
work, we design a 3D MR-STAT framework based on previous 2D work, in order to
achieve better image SNR, higher though-plan resolution and better tissue
characterization. Specifically, we design a 7-minute, high-resolution 3D
MR-STAT sequence, and the corresponding two-step reconstruction algorithm for
the large-scale dataset. To reduce the long acquisition time, Cartesian
undersampling strategies such as SENSE are adopted in our transient-state
quantitative framework. To reduce the computational burden, a data splitting
scheme is designed for decoupling the 3D reconstruction problem into
independent 2D reconstructions. The proposed 3D framework is validated by
numerical simulations, phantom experiments and in-vivo experiments.
High-quality knee quantitative maps with 0.8 x 0.8 x 1.5mm3 resolution and

"Unsupervised Decomposition Networks for Bias Field Correction in MR
  Image","Bias field, which is caused by imperfect MR devices or imaged objects,
introduces intensity inhomogeneity into MR images and degrades the performance
of MR image analysis methods. Many retrospective algorithms were developed to
facilitate the bias correction, to which the deep learning-based methods
outperformed. However, in the training phase, the supervised deep
learning-based methods heavily rely on the synthesized bias field. As the
formation of the bias field is extremely complex, it is difficult to mimic the
true physical property of MR images by synthesized data. While bias field
correction and image segmentation are strongly related, the segmentation map is
precisely obtained by decoupling the bias field from the original MR image, and
the bias value is indicated by the segmentation map in reverse. Thus, we
proposed novel unsupervised decomposition networks that are trained only with
biased data to obtain the bias-free MR images. Networks are made up of: a
segmentation part to predict the probability of every pixel belonging to each
class, and an estimation part to calculate the bias field, which are optimized
alternately. Furthermore, loss functions based on the combination of fuzzy
clustering and the multiplicative bias field are also devised. The proposed
loss functions introduce the smoothness of bias field and construct the soft
relationships among different classes under intra-consistency constraints.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately
estimate bias fields and produce better bias correction results. The code is

  Theory and Methods: A quarter of the typically acquired number of transients
collected in GABA-edited MRS scans are pre-processed and converted to a
spectrogram image representation using the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).
The image representation of the data allows the adaptation of a pre-trained ViT

  Results: The Spectro-ViT model significantly outperformed all other models in
four out of five quantitative metrics (mean squared error, shape score,
GABA+/water fit error, and full width at half maximum). The metabolite
concentrations estimated (GABA+/water, GABA+/Cr, and Glx/water) were consistent
with the metabolite concentrations estimated using typical GABA-edited MRS

GaitGuard: Towards Private Gait in Mixed Reality,"Augmented/Mixed Reality (AR/MR) devices are unique from other mobile systems
because of their capability to offer an immersive multi-user collaborative
experience. While previous studies have explored privacy and security aspects
of multiple user interactions in AR/MR, a less-explored area is the
vulnerability of gait privacy. Gait is considered a private state because it is
a highly individualistic and a distinctive biometric trait. Thus, preserving
gait privacy in emerging AR/MR systems is crucial to safeguard individuals from
potential identity tracking and unauthorized profiling.
  This paper first introduces GaitExtract, a framework designed to
automatically detect gait information in humans, shedding light on the nuances
of gait privacy in AR/MR. In this paper, we designed GaitExtract, a framework
that can automatically detect the outside gait information of a human and
investigate the vulnerability of gait privacy in AR. In a user study with 20
participants, our findings reveal that participants were uniquely identifiable
with an accuracy of up to 78% using GaitExtract. Consequently, we propose
GaitGuard, a system that safeguards gait information of people appearing in the

  Furthermore, we tested GaitGuard in an MR collaborative application,
achieving 22 fps while streaming mitigated frames to the collaborative server.
Our user-study survey indicated that users are more comfortable with releasing

"Noise-Compensated, Bias-Corrected Diffusion Weighted Endorectal Magnetic
  Resonance Imaging via a Stochastically Fully-Connected Joint Conditional
  Random Field Model","Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MR) is a powerful tool in
imaging-based prostate cancer screening and detection. Endorectal coils are
commonly used in DW-MR imaging to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of
the acquisition, at the expense of significant intensity inhomogeneities (bias
field) that worsens as we move away from the endorectal coil. The presence of
bias field can have a significant negative impact on the accuracy of different
image analysis tasks, as well as prostate tumor localization, thus leading to
increased inter- and intra-observer variability. Retrospective bias correction
approaches are introduced as a more efficient way of bias correction compared
to the prospective methods such that they correct for both of the scanner and
anatomy-related bias fields in MR imaging. Previously proposed retrospective
bias field correction methods suffer from undesired noise amplification that
can reduce the quality of bias-corrected DW-MR image. Here, we propose a
unified data reconstruction approach that enables joint compensation of bias
field as well as data noise in DW-MR imaging. The proposed noise-compensated,
bias-corrected (NCBC) data reconstruction method takes advantage of a novel
stochastically fully connected joint conditional random field (SFC-JCRF) model
to mitigate the effects of data noise and bias field in the reconstructed MR
data. The proposed NCBC reconstruction method was tested on synthetic DW-MR
data, physical DW-phantom as well as real DW-MR data all acquired using
endorectal MR coil. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis illustrated that
the proposed NCBC method can achieve improved image quality when compared to

"Regional accuracy of ZTE-based attenuation correction in static and
  dynamic brain PET/MR","Accurate MR-based attenuation correction (MRAC) is essential for quantitative
PET/MR imaging of the brain. In this study, we analyze the regional bias caused
by MRAC based on Zero-Echo-Time MR images (ZTEAC) compared to CT-based AC
(CTAC) in static and dynamic PET imaging. In addition the results are compared
to the performance of the current default Atlas-based AC (AtlasAC) implemented
in the GE SIGNA PET/MR.
  Methods: Thirty static [18F]FDG and 11 dynamic [18}F]PE2I acquisitions from a
GE SIGNA PET/MR were reconstructed using ZTEAC (using a research tool, GE
Healthcare), single-subject AtlasAC (the current default AC in GE's SIGNA
PET/MR) and CTAC (from a PET/CT acquisition of the same day). In the 30 static
[18F]FDG reconstructions, the bias caused by ZTEAC and AtlasAC in the mean
uptake of 85 anatomical volumes of interest (VOIs) of the Hammers' atlas was
analyzed in PMOD. For the 11 dynamic [18}F]PE2I reconstructions, the bias
caused by ZTEAC and AtlasAC in the non displaceable binding potential BPnd in
the striatum was calculated with cerebellum as the reference region and a
simplified reference tissue model.
  Results: The regional bias caused by ZTEAC in the static [18F]FDG
reconstructions ranged from -8.0% to +7.7% (mean 0.1%, SD 2.0%). For AtlasAC
this bias ranged from -31.6% to +16.6% (mean -0.4%, SD 4.3%). The bias caused
by AtlasAC showed a clear gradient in the cranio-caudal direction (-4.2% in the
cerebellum, +6.6% in the left superior frontal gyrus). The bias in the striatal
BPnd for the [18F]PE2I reconstructions ranged from -0.8% to +4.8% (mean 1.5%,
SD 1.4%) using ZTEAC and from -0.6% to +9.4% using AtlasAC (mean 4.2%, SD
2.6%).
  Conclusion: ZTEAC provides excellent quantitative accuracy for static and
dynamic brain PET/MR, comparable to CTAC, and is clearly superior to the
default AtlasAC currently implemented in the GE SIGNA PET/MR.","['Georg Schramm', 'Michel Koole', 'Stefanie M. A.

"Cross-modality (CT-MRI) prior augmented deep learning for robust lung
  tumor segmentation from small MR datasets","Lack of large expert annotated MR datasets makes training deep learning
models difficult. Therefore, a cross-modality (MR-CT) deep learning
segmentation approach that augments training data using pseudo MR images
produced by transforming expert-segmented CT images was developed. Eighty-One
T2-weighted MRI scans from 28 patients with non-small cell lung cancers were
analyzed. Cross-modality prior encoding the transformation of CT to pseudo MR
images resembling T2w MRI was learned as a generative adversarial deep learning
model. This model augmented training data arising from 6 expert-segmented T2w
MR patient scans with 377 pseudo MRI from non-small cell lung cancer CT patient
scans with obtained from the Cancer Imaging Archive. A two-dimensional Unet
implemented with batch normalization was trained to segment the tumors from T2w
MRI. This method was benchmarked against (a) standard data augmentation and two
state-of-the art cross-modality pseudo MR-based augmentation and (b) two
segmentation networks. Segmentation accuracy was computed using Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC), Hausdroff distance metrics, and volume ratio. The proposed
approach produced the lowest statistical variability in the intensity
distribution between pseudo and T2w MR images measured as Kullback-Leibler
divergence of 0.069. This method produced the highest segmentation accuracy
with a DSC of 0.75 and the lowest Hausdroff distance on the test dataset. This
approach produced highly similar estimations of tumor growth as an expert (P =
0.37). A novel deep learning MR segmentation was developed that overcomes the
limitation of learning robust models from small datasets by leveraging learned
cross-modality priors to augment training. The results show the feasibility of
the approach and the corresponding improvement over the state-of-the-art
methods.","['Jue Jiang', 'Yu-Chi Hu', 'Neelam Tyagi', 'Pengpeng Zhang', 'Andreas Rimner', 'Joseph O. Deasy', 'Harini Veeraraghavan']",2019-01-31T14:17:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11369v2
"Gaussian Processes for real-time 3D motion and uncertainty estimation
  during MR-guided radiotherapy","Respiratory motion during radiotherapy causes uncertainty in the tumor's
location, which is typically addressed by an increased radiation area and a
decreased dose. As a result, the treatments' efficacy is reduced. The recently
proposed hybrid MR-linac scanner holds the promise to efficiently deal with
such respiratory motion through real-time adaptive MR-guided radiotherapy
(MRgRT). For MRgRT, motion-fields should be estimated from MR-data and the
radiotherapy plan should be adapted in real-time according to the estimated
motion-fields. All of this should be performed with a total latency of
maximally 200 ms, including data acquisition and reconstruction. A measure of
confidence in such estimated motion-fields is highly desirable, for instance to
ensure the patient's safety in case of unexpected and undesirable motion. In
this work, we propose a framework based on Gaussian Processes to infer 3D
motion-fields and uncertainty maps in real-time from only three readouts of
MR-data. We demonstrated an inference frame rate up to 69 Hz including data
acquisition and reconstruction, thereby exploiting the limited amount of
required MR-data. Additionally, we designed a rejection criterion based on the
motion-field uncertainty maps to demonstrate the framework's potential for
quality assurance. The framework was validated in silico and in vivo on healthy
volunteer data (n=5) acquired using an MR-linac, thereby taking into account
different breathing patterns and controlled bulk motion. Results indicate
end-point-errors with a 75th percentile below 1mm in silico, and a correct
detection of erroneous motion estimates with the rejection criterion.
Altogether, the results show the potential of the framework for application in
real-time MR-guided radiotherapy with an MR-linac.","['Niek R. F. Huttinga', 'Tom Bruijnen', 'Cornelis A. T. van den Berg', 'Alessandro Sbrizzi']",2022-04-21T04:24:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09873v1
HACA3: A Unified Approach for Multi-site MR Image Harmonization,"The lack of standardization is a prominent issue in magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging. This often causes undesired contrast variations in the acquired images
due to differences in hardware and acquisition parameters. In recent years,
image synthesis-based MR harmonization with disentanglement has been proposed
to compensate for the undesired contrast variations. Despite the success of
existing methods, we argue that three major improvements can be made. First,
most existing methods are built upon the assumption that multi-contrast MR
images of the same subject share the same anatomy. This assumption is
questionable, since different MR contrasts are specialized to highlight
different anatomical features. Second, these methods often require a fixed set
of MR contrasts for training (e.g., both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images),
limiting their applicability. Lastly, existing methods are generally sensitive
to imaging artifacts. In this paper, we present Harmonization with
Attention-based Contrast, Anatomy, and Artifact Awareness (HACA3), a novel
approach to address these three issues. HACA3 incorporates an anatomy fusion
module that accounts for the inherent anatomical differences between MR
contrasts. Furthermore, HACA3 is also robust to imaging artifacts and can be
trained and applied to any set of MR contrasts. HACA3 is developed and
evaluated on diverse MR datasets acquired from 21 sites with varying field
strengths, scanner platforms, and acquisition protocols. Experiments show that
HACA3 achieves state-of-the-art performance under multiple image quality
metrics. We also demonstrate the applicability and versatility of HACA3 on
downstream tasks including white matter lesion segmentation and longitudinal
volumetric analyses.","['Lianrui Zuo', 'Yihao Liu', 'Yuan Xue', 'Blake E. Dewey', 'Samuel W. Remedios', 'Savannah P. Hays', 'Murat Bilgel', 'Ellen M. Mowry', 'Scott D. Newsome', 'Peter A.

"DAC-MR: Data Augmentation Consistency Based Meta-Regularization for
  Meta-Learning","Meta learning recently has been heavily researched and helped advance the
contemporary machine learning. However, achieving well-performing meta-learning
model requires a large amount of training tasks with high-quality meta-data
representing the underlying task generalization goal, which is sometimes
difficult and expensive to obtain for real applications. Current
meta-data-driven meta-learning approaches, however, are fairly hard to train
satisfactory meta-models with imperfect training tasks. To address this issue,
we suggest a meta-knowledge informed meta-learning (MKIML) framework to improve
meta-learning by additionally integrating compensated meta-knowledge into
meta-learning process. We preliminarily integrate meta-knowledge into
meta-objective via using an appropriate meta-regularization (MR) objective to
regularize capacity complexity of the meta-model function class to facilitate
better generalization on unseen tasks. As a practical implementation, we
introduce data augmentation consistency to encode invariance as meta-knowledge
for instantiating MR objective, denoted by DAC-MR. The proposed DAC-MR is
hopeful to learn well-performing meta-models from training tasks with noisy,
sparse or unavailable meta-data. We theoretically demonstrate that DAC-MR can
be treated as a proxy meta-objective used to evaluate meta-model without
high-quality meta-data. Besides, meta-data-driven meta-loss objective combined
with DAC-MR is capable of achieving better meta-level generalization. 10
meta-learning tasks with different network architectures and benchmarks
substantiate the capability of our DAC-MR on aiding meta-model learning. Fine
performance of DAC-MR are obtained across all settings, and are well-aligned
with our theoretical insights. This implies that our DAC-MR is
problem-agnostic, and hopeful to be readily applied to extensive meta-learning
problems and tasks.","['Jun Shu', 'Xiang Yuan', 'Deyu Meng', 'Zongben Xu']",2023-05-13T11:01:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07892v1
"CT-based Subchondral Bone Microstructural Analysis in Knee
  Osteoarthritis via MR-Guided Distillation Learning","Background: MR-based subchondral bone effectively predicts knee
osteoarthritis. However, its clinical application is limited by the cost and
time of MR. Purpose: We aim to develop a novel distillation-learning-based
method named SRRD for subchondral bone microstructural analysis using
easily-acquired CT images, which leverages paired MR images to enhance the
CT-based analysis model during training. Materials and Methods: Knee joint
images of both CT and MR modalities were collected from October 2020 to May
2021. Firstly, we developed a GAN-based generative model to transform MR images
into CT images, which was used to establish the anatomical correspondence
between the two modalities. Next, we obtained numerous patches of subchondral
bone regions of MR images, together with their trabecular parameters (BV / TV,
Tb. Th, Tb. Sp, Tb. N) from the corresponding CT image patches via regression.
The distillation-learning technique was used to train the regression model and
transfer MR structural information to the CT-based model. The regressed
trabecular parameters were further used for knee osteoarthritis classification.
Results: A total of 80 participants were evaluated. CT-based regression results
of trabecular parameters achieved intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs)
of 0.804, 0.773, 0.711, and 0.622 for BV / TV, Tb. Th, Tb. Sp, and Tb. N,
respectively. The use of distillation learning significantly improved the
performance of the CT-based knee osteoarthritis classification method using the
CNN approach, yielding an AUC score of 0.767 (95% CI, 0.681-0.853) instead of
0.658 (95% CI, 0.574-0.742) (p<.001). Conclusions: The proposed SRRD method
showed high reliability and validity in MR-CT registration, regression, and
knee osteoarthritis classification, indicating the feasibility of subchondral
bone microstructural analysis based on CT images.","['Yuqi Hu', 'Xiangyu Zhao', 'Gaowei Qing', 'Kai Xie', 'Chenglei Liu', 'Lichi Zhang']",2023-07-10T07:54:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04390v2
"A Unified Generation-Registration Framework for Improved MR-based CT
  Synthesis in Proton Therapy","Background: In MR-guided proton therapy planning, aligning MR and CT images
is key for MR-based CT synthesis, especially in mobile regions like the
head-and-neck. Misalignments here can lead to less accurate synthetic CT (sCT)
images, impacting treatment precision. Purpose: This study introduces a novel
network that cohesively unifies image generation and registration processes to
enhance the quality and anatomical fidelity of sCTs derived from better-aligned
MR images. Methods: The approach synergizes a generation network (G) with a
deformable registration network (R), optimizing them jointly in MR-to-CT
synthesis. This goal is achieved by alternately minimizing the discrepancies
between the generated/registered CT images and their corresponding reference CT
counterparts. The generation network employs a UNet architecture, while the
registration network leverages an implicit neural representation of the
Deformable Vector Fields (DVFs). We validated this method on a dataset
comprising 60 Head-and-Neck patients, reserving 12 cases for holdout testing.
Results: Compared to the baseline Pix2Pix method with MAE 124.95\pm 30.74 HU,
the proposed technique demonstrated 80.98\pm 7.55 HU. The unified
translation-registration network produced sharper and more anatomically
congruent outputs, showing superior efficacy in converting MR images to sCTs.
Additionally, from a dosimetric perspective, the plan recalculated on the
resulting sCTs resulted in a remarkably reduced discrepancy to the reference
proton plans. Conclusions: This study conclusively demonstrates that a holistic
MR-based CT synthesis approach, integrating both image-to-image translation and
deformable registration, significantly improves the precision and quality of
sCT generation, particularly for the challenging body area with varied anatomic
changes between corresponding MR and CT.","['Xia Li', 'Renato Bellotti', 'Barbara Bachtiary', 'Jan Hrbacek', 'Damien C. Weber', 'Antony J. Lomax', 'Joachim M. Buhmann', 'Ye Zhang']",2024-01-23T16:15:31Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12878v1

$ T $\leq $ 25K). We find a strong dependence of the nature of MR on the oxygen
stoichiometry. The MR at low temperatures change from positive to negative as
the sample becomes more oxygen deficient (i.e, $\delta$ increases). Some of the
samples which are more resistive, show a resistivity minima at $T_{min}$
$\approx$ 20K. We find that in these samples the MR is positive at T >
$T_{min}$ and negative for T < $T_{min}$. We conclude that in the absence of
strong magnetic interaction, the negative MR in these oxides can arise from
weak localisation effects.","['N. Gayathri', 'A. K. Raychaudhuri', 'X. Q. Xu', 'J. L. Peng', 'R. L. Greene']",1998-07-24T14:25:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9807330v1

system in (100) Si-inversion layers, for perpendicular and parallel
orientations of the current with respect to the magnetic field in the 2D-plane.
The magnetoresistance is almost isotropic; this result does not support the
suggestion of the orbital origin of the MR in Si-inversion layer. In the
hopping regime, however, the MR contains a weak anisotropic component that is
non-monotonic in magnetic field. We found that the field, at which the MR
saturates, for different samples varies by a factor of two, being lower or
higher than the field of complete spin polarization of free carriers.
Therefore, the saturation of the MR can not be identified with the spin
polarization of free carriers.","['V. M. Pudalov', 'G. Brunthaler', 'A. Prinz', 'G. Bauer']",2000-04-12T20:02:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0004206v3

Pr0.9Sr0.1CoO2.99 in an applied field of 100 Oe show that, as temperature
decreases, the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) magnetisation
curves branch clearly at 50 K, and a cusp appears in the ZFC branch at Tcusp 20

that both the ZFC-FC branching temperature and, Tcusp, decrease with increasing

typical of ferromagnets. No appreciable MR is seen in this compound at 50 K,

of domain walls that run perpendicular to both the magnetization and the
current, a geometry existing only in materials with perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy. As a result, the extraordinary Hall effect (EHE) gives rise to
circulating currents in the vicinity of the domain walls that contributes to

"Non-saturating magnetoresistance of inhomogeneous conductors: comparison
  of experiment and simulation","The silver chalcogenides provide a striking example of the benefits of
imperfection. Nanothreads of excess silver cause distortions in the current
flow that yield a linear and non-saturating transverse magnetoresistance (MR).
Associated with the large and positive MR is a negative longitudinal MR. The
longitudinal MR only occurs in the three-dimensional limit and thereby permits
the determination of a characteristic length scale set by the spatial
inhomogeneity. We find that this fundamental inhomogeneity length can be as
large as ten microns. Systematic measurements of the diagonal and off-diagonal
components of the resistivity tensor in various sample geometries show clear
evidence of the distorted current paths posited in theoretical simulations. We
use a random resistor network model to fit the linear MR, and expand it from
two to three dimensions to depict current distortions in the third (thickness)
dimension. When compared directly to experiments on Ag$_{2\pm\delta}$Se and
Ag$_{2\pm\delta}$Te, in magnetic fields up to 55 T, the model identifies
conductivity fluctuations due to macroscopic inhomogeneities as the underlying
physical mechanism. It also accounts reasonably quantitatively for the various

holds in many conventional metals. We show that a pronounced crossover from
negative to positive MR of CeCoIn5 that occurs at elevated temperatures is
determined by the dependence of the effective mass M*(B,T) on both magnetic
field B and temperature T. Thus, the crossover is regulated by the universal
behavior of M*(B,T) observed in heavy-fermion metals. This behavior is
exhibited by M*(B,T) when a strongly correlated electron system transits from
the Landau Fermi liquid behavior induced by the application of magnetic field
to the non-Fermi liquid behavior taking place at rising temperatures. Our
calculations of MR are in good agreement with facts and reveal new scaling

"Cooling a mechanical resonator via coupling to a tunable double quantum

backaction induced by the capacitive coupling between the DQD and the MR. The
DQD is excited by a microwave field and afterwards a tunneling event results in
the decay of the excited state of the DQD. An important advantage of this
system is that both the energy level splitting and the decay rate of the DQD
can be well tuned by varying the gate voltage. We find that the steady average
occupancy, below unity, of the MR can be achieved by changing both the decay
rate of the excited state and the detuning between the transition frequency of
the DQD and the microwave frequency, in analogy to the laser sideband cooling
of an atom or trapped ion in atomic physics. Our results show that the cooling

been investigated in polycrystalline, Nd_{0.84}Sr_{0.16}CoO_3. A strong
exchange bias (EB) effect is observed associated with the fairly large
intragranular magnetoresistance (MR). The EB effect observed in the MR curve is
compared with the EB effect manifested in magnetic hysteresis loop. Training
effect, described as the decrease of EB effect when the sample is successively
field-cycled at a particular temperature, has been observed in the shift of the
MR curve. Training effect could be analysed by the successful models. The EB
effect, MR and a considerable time dependence in MR are attributed to the
intrinsic nanostructure giving rise to the varieties of magnetic interfaces in
the grain interior.","['M. Patra', 'S. Majumdar', 'S. Giri']",2009-08-26T14:21:34Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3833v1
"Evolution of kinklike fluctuations associated with ion pickup within
  reconnection outflows in the Earth's magnetotail","Magnetic reconnection (MR) in Earth's magnetotail is usually followed by a
systemwide redistribution of explosively released kinetic and thermal energy.
Recently, multispacecraft observations from the THEMIS mission were used to
study localized explosions associated with MR in the magnetotail so as to
understand subsequent Earthward propagation of MR outbursts during substorms.
Here we investigate plasma and magnetic field fluctuations/structures
associated with MR exhaust and ion-ion kink mode instability during a well
documented MR event. Generation, evolution and fading of kinklike oscillations
are followed over a distance of 70 000 km from the reconnection site in the
midmagnetotail to the more dipolar region near the Earth. We have found that
the kink oscillations driven by different ion populations within the outflow
region can be at least 25 000 km from the reconnection site.","['Z. Voros', 'M. P. Leubner', 'A. Runov', 'V. Angelopoulos', 'W. Baumjohann']",2009-12-14T09:26:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2597v1
"Cooling a mechanical resonator by quantum interference in a triple
  quantum dot","We propose an approach to cool a mechanical resonator (MR) via quantum
interference in a triple quantum dot (TQD) capacitively coupled to the MR. The
TQD connected to three electrodes is an electronic analog of a three-level atom
in $\Lambda$ configuration. The electrons can tunnel from the left electrode
into one of the two dots with lower-energy states, but can only tunnel out from
the higher-energy state at the third dot to the right electrode. When the two
lower-energy states are tuned to be degenerate, an electron in the TQD can be
trapped in a superposition of the degenerate states called the dark state. This
effect is caused by the destructive quantum interference between tunneling from
the two lower-energy states to the higher-energy state. Under this condition,
an electron in the dark state readily absorbs an energy quantum from the MR.
Repeating this process, the MR can be cooled to its ground state. Moreover, we
propose a scheme for verifying the cooling result by measuring the current
spectrum of a charge detector adjacent to a double quantum dot coupled to the
MR.","['Shi-Hua Ouyang', 'Chi-Hang Lam', 'J. Q. You']",2010-01-08T14:35:12Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1286v1

pure graphitic multilayers transforms into a negative MR after introducing
significant short-range disorders (implanted boron or carbon atoms), consistent
with recent non-Markovian transport theory. Our experiments suggest the
important role of the non-Markovian process in the intriguing MR behavior for

which is essential to the topological SS, while the negative MR to the weak
localization (WL) in the transport through the bulk state (two-dimensional bulk

On Partial Maximally-Recoverable and Maximally-Recoverable Codes,"An [n, k] linear code C that is subject to locality constraints imposed by a
parity check matrix H0 is said to be a maximally recoverable (MR) code if it
can recover from any erasure pattern that some k-dimensional subcode of the
null space of H0 can recover from. The focus in this paper is on MR codes
constrained to have all-symbol locality r. Given that it is challenging to
construct MR codes having small field size, we present results in two
directions. In the first, we relax the MR constraint and require only that
apart from the requirement of being an optimum all-symbol locality code, the
code must yield an MDS code when punctured in a single, specific pattern which
ensures that each local code is punctured in precisely one coordinate and that
no two local codes share the same punctured coordinate. We term these codes as
partially maximally recoverable (PMR) codes. We provide a simple construction
for high-rate PMR codes and then provide a general, promising approach that
needs further investigation. In the second direction, we present three

magnetic fluids containing Co0.9Ni0.1 nanocluster that have been measured as a

synthesized by conventional homogeneous nucleation in liquid polyol.
Morphological characterization using FESEM revealed the non-aggregated nature
of nanoclusters with an average diameter of 450 nm. Crystal structure and room
temperature magnetization measurements were performed by powder XRD and
vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM). Two MR samples of different particle
volume fractions were prepared. Temperature-dependent steady shear MR
characterizations for both the samples in the range of 250C-550C demonstrated
systematic decline of MR parameters with increasing temperatures. The
temperature-induced thinning of shear stress and viscosity was explained in
terms of change in effective volume fraction and magnetic saturation. To
analyze the measured variation in MR response with increasing temperature,
suitable temperature-sensitive scaling parameters were also constructed.
Finally to generalize the trend, rheological master curves were constructed by
using time-temperature-field superposition method.","['Injamamul Arief', 'P. K. Mukhopadhyay']",2015-05-28T07:28:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07567v1

across the first order martensite transformation (MT) of Ni44Cu2Mn43In11 alloy.
Within the metastability of MT, an isothermal application of magnetic field
converts the martensite into austenite. The field induced austenite phase
fraction (fIA) at any temperature depends on the availability and instability
of martensite phase fraction (fM ) at that temperature. This fIA is found to
contribute most significantly to the observed giant MR while the contribution
from pure martensite and austenite phase fraction is negligible. It is found
that the net MR follows a non linear proportional relation with the fIA and the
ascending and descending branch of fIA follows different power law giving rise
to hysteresis in MR. Here we present a detail explanation of the observed
behaviours of MR based on the existing phase fraction.","['Mayukh K. Ray', 'Bibekananda Maji', 'M. Modak', 'K. Bagani', 'S. Banerjee']",2015-08-05T14:19:08Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01085v1

electric conductivity that depends on the magnetization orientation, but its
form is very different from both the anisotropic and spin Hall MR. The in-plane
MR vanishes identically for non-magnetic disorder, while out-of-plane

well-captured by a two-fluid model. According to the model, the change of MR
could be as large as 400,000%, the largest potential change of MR among all

"Origin of the large positive magnetoresistance in Ge1-xMnx granular thin

applications due to large positive magnetoresistance (MR). Previous studies on
GeMn have suggested that the large MR is related to nanospinodal decomposition
of GeMn into Mn-rich ferromagnetic nanoparticles and Mn-poor paramagnetic
matrix. However, its microscopic origin of the MR has not been clarified yet.
Here, using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), which is extremely
sensitive to the local magnetic state of each atom, we investigate the magnetic
properties of the nanoparticles and the matrix in GeMn separately. We find that
the MR ratio is proportional to the product of the magnetizations originating
from the nanoparticles and the matrix. This result indicates that
spin-polarized holes in the nanoparticles penetrate into the matrix and that
these holes undergo spin-disorder magnetic scattering by the paramagnetic Mn
atoms in the matrix, which induces the large MR.","['Yuki K.

Rate-Adaptive Neural Networks for Spatial Multiplexers,"In resource-constrained environments, one can employ spatial multiplexing
cameras to acquire a small number of measurements of a scene, and perform
effective reconstruction or high-level inference using purely data-driven
neural networks. However, once trained, the measurement matrix and the network
are valid only for a single measurement rate (MR) chosen at training time. To
overcome this drawback, we answer the following question: How can we jointly
design the measurement operator and the reconstruction/inference network so
that the system can operate over a \textit{range} of MRs? To this end, we
present a novel training algorithm, for learning
\textbf{\textit{rate-adaptive}} networks. Using standard datasets, we
demonstrate that, when tested over a range of MRs, a rate-adaptive network can
provide high quality reconstruction over a the entire range, resulting in up to
about 15 dB improvement over previous methods, where the network is valid for
only one MR. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for
sample-efficient object tracking where video frames are acquired at dynamically

"Newton-MR: Inexact Newton Method With Minimum Residual Sub-problem
  Solver","We consider a variant of inexact Newton Method, called Newton-MR, in which
the least-squares sub-problems are solved approximately using Minimum Residual
method. By construction, Newton-MR can be readily applied for unconstrained
optimization of a class of non-convex problems known as invex, which subsumes
convexity as a sub-class. For invex optimization, instead of the classical
Lipschitz continuity assumptions on gradient and Hessian, Newton-MR's global
convergence can be guaranteed under a weaker notion of joint regularity of
Hessian and gradient. We also obtain Newton-MR's problem-independent local
convergence to the set of minima. We show that fast local/global convergence
can be guaranteed under a novel inexactness condition, which, to our knowledge,
is much weaker than the prior related works. Numerical results demonstrate the
performance of Newton-MR as compared with several other Newton-type
alternatives on a few machine learning problems.","['Fred Roosta', 'Yang Liu', 'Peng Xu', 'Michael W. Mahoney']",2018-09-30T03:07:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00303v4

language (NL) utterances into formal meaning representations (MRs). TRANX uses
a transition system based on the abstract syntax description language for the
target MR, which gives it two major advantages: (1) it is highly accurate,
using information from the syntax of the target MR to constrain the output
space and model the information flow, and (2) it is highly generalizable, and
can easily be applied to new types of MR by just writing a new abstract syntax
description corresponding to the allowable structures in the MR. Experiments on
four different semantic parsing and code generation tasks show that our system
is generalizable, extensible, and effective, registering strong results

MRI Super-Resolution with Ensemble Learning and Complementary Priors,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used medical imaging modality.
However, due to the limitations in hardware, scan time, and throughput, it is
often clinically challenging to obtain high-quality MR images. The
super-resolution approach is potentially promising to improve MR image quality
without any hardware upgrade. In this paper, we propose an ensemble learning
and deep learning framework for MR image super-resolution. In our study, we
first enlarged low resolution images using 5 commonly used super-resolution
algorithms and obtained differentially enlarged image datasets with
complementary priors. Then, a generative adversarial network (GAN) is trained
with each dataset to generate super-resolution MR images. Finally, a
convolutional neural network is used for ensemble learning that synergizes the
outputs of GANs into the final MR super-resolution images. According to our
results, the ensemble learning results outcome any one of GAN outputs. Compared
with some state-of-the-art deep learning-based super-resolution methods, our
approach is advantageous in suppressing artifacts and keeping more image
details.","['Qing Lyu', 'Hongming Shan', 'Ge Wang']",2019-07-06T02:43:30Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03063v1
Automatic Online Quality Control of Synthetic CTs,"Accurate MR-to-CT synthesis is a requirement for MR-only workflows in
radiotherapy (RT) treatment planning. In recent years, deep learning-based
approaches have shown impressive results in this field. However, to prevent
downstream errors in RT treatment planning, it is important that deep learning
models are only applied to data for which they are trained and that generated
synthetic CT (sCT) images do not contain severe errors. For this, a mechanism
for online quality control should be in place. In this work, we use an ensemble
of sCT generators and assess their disagreement as a measure of uncertainty of
the results. We show that this uncertainty measure can be used for two kinds of
online quality control. First, to detect input images that are outside the
expected distribution of MR images. Second, to identify sCT images that were
generated from suitable MR images but potentially contain errors. Such
automatic online quality control for sCT generation is likely to become an
integral part of MR-only RT workflows.","['Louis D. van Harten', 'Jelmer M. Wolterink', 'Joost J. C. Verhoeff', 'Ivana Išgum']",2019-11-12T16:19:20Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04986v1

completely opaque VR devices to be ""cloaked,"" switching to AR or MR while
providing correct three-dimensional (3D) parallax and perspective of the real

"Combining Pyramid Pooling and Attention Mechanism for Pelvic MR Image
  Semantic Segmentaion","One of the time-consuming routine work for a radiologist is to discern
anatomical structures from tomographic images. For assisting radiologists, this
paper develops an automatic segmentation method for pelvic magnetic resonance
(MR) images. The task has three major challenges 1) A pelvic organ can have
various sizes and shapes depending on the axial image, which requires local
contexts to segment correctly. 2) Different organs often have quite similar
appearance in MR images, which requires global context to segment. 3) The
number of available annotated images are very small to use the latest
segmentation algorithms. To address the challenges, we propose a novel
convolutional neural network called Attention-Pyramid network (APNet) that
effectively exploits both local and global contexts, in addition to a
data-augmentation technique that is particularly effective for MR images. In
order to evaluate our method, we construct fine-grained (50 pelvic organs) MR
image segmentation dataset, and experimentally confirm the superior performance
of our techniques over the state-of-the-art image segmentation methods.","['Ting-Ting Liang', 'Satoshi Tsutsui', 'Liangcai Gao', 'Jing-Jing Lu', 'Mengyan Sun']",2018-06-01T10:13:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00264v2
Learning to Decode 7T-like MR Image Reconstruction from 3T MR Images,"Increasing demand for high field magnetic resonance (MR) scanner indicates
the need for high-quality MR images for accurate medical diagnosis. However,
cost constraints, instead, motivate a need for algorithms to enhance images
from low field scanners. We propose an approach to process the given low field
(3T) MR image slices to reconstruct the corresponding high field (7T-like)
slices. Our framework involves a novel architecture of a merged convolutional
autoencoder with a single encoder and multiple decoders. Specifically, we
employ three decoders with random initializations, and the proposed training
approach involves selection of a particular decoder in each weight-update
iteration for back propagation. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
outperforms some related contemporary methods in terms of performance and
reconstruction time.","['Aditya Sharma', 'Prabhjot Kaur', 'Aditya Nigam', 'Arnav Bhavsar']",2018-06-18T18:46:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06886v1
"Which Contrast Does Matter? Towards a Deep Understanding of MR Contrast
  using Collaborative GAN","Thanks to the recent success of generative adversarial network (GAN) for
image synthesis, there are many exciting GAN approaches that successfully
synthesize MR image contrast from other images with different contrasts. These
approaches are potentially important for image imputation problems, where
complete set of data is often difficult to obtain and image synthesis is one of
the key solutions for handling the missing data problem. Unfortunately, the
lack of the scalability of the existing GAN-based image translation approaches
poses a fundamental challenge to understand the nature of the MR contrast
imputation problem: which contrast does matter? Here, we present a systematic
approach using Collaborative Generative Adversarial Networks (CollaGAN), which
enable the learning of the joint image manifold of multiple MR contrasts to
investigate which contrasts are essential. Our experimental results showed that
the exogenous contrast from contrast agents is not replaceable, but other
endogenous contrast such as T1, T2, etc can be synthesized from other contrast.

Towards multi-sequence MR image recovery from undersampled k-space data,"Undersampled MR image recovery has been widely studied for accelerated MR
acquisition. However, it has been mostly studied under a single sequence
scenario, despite the fact that multi-sequence MR scan is common in practice.
In this paper, we aim to optimize multi-sequence MR image recovery from
undersampled k-space data under an overall time constraint while considering
the difference in acquisition time for various sequences. We first formulate it
as a constrained optimization problem and then show that finding the optimal
sampling strategy for all sequences and the best recovery model at the same
time is combinatorial and hence computationally prohibitive. To solve this
problem, we propose a blind recovery model that simultaneously recovers
multiple sequences, and an efficient approach to find proper combination of
sampling strategy and recovery model. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms sequence-wise recovery, and sheds light on how to
decide the undersampling strategy for sequences within an overall time budget.","['Cheng Peng', 'Wei-An Lin', 'Rama Chellappa', 'S. Kevin Zhou']",2019-08-15T16:01:47Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05615v2

"Charge Density Modulation and Defect Ordering in Na$_x$MnBi$_y$ magnetic
  semimetal","The I-Mn-V antiferromagnet, NaMnBi, develops a very large positive
magnetoresistance (MR) up to 10,000% at 2 K and 9 T in crystals showing a
semiconductor-to-metal transition (SMT). In the absence of an SMT, a modest
(20%) MR is achieved. Here, we show that upon cooling below the magnetic
transition, a spatial modulation appears giving rise to new Bragg peaks due to
charge and defect ordering in a checkerboard pattern, with two kinds of
modulation vectors, $q_1$=($\frac23$, 0, 1) and $q_2$=($\frac23, \frac13,
\frac12$). This constitutes a superlattice transition ($T_s$) that lowers the
symmetry from the high temperature centrosymmetric P4/nmm to the
non-centrosymmetric P$\overline4$m2. In crystals with a large MR, a close to
room temperature $T_s$ is observed with $q_1$ appearing first, followed by
$q_2$. In crystals with low MR however, $T_s$ is much lower and only $q_1$ is
observed. The charge modulation and spin fluctuations may both contribute to
the enhancement of MR.","['Aaron Wegner', 'Despina Louca', 'Keith Taddei', 'Joerg Neuefeind']",2020-02-28T22:09:09Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00089v1

  Loss for Brain MR Image Synthesis","Magnetic Resonance (MR) images of different modalities can provide
complementary information for clinical diagnosis, but whole modalities are
often costly to access. Most existing methods only focus on synthesizing
missing images between two modalities, which limits their robustness and
efficiency when multiple modalities are missing. To address this problem, we
propose a multi-modality generative adversarial network (MGAN) to synthesize
three high-quality MR modalities (FLAIR, T1 and T1ce) from one MR modality T2
simultaneously. The experimental results show that the quality of the
synthesized images by our proposed methods is better than the one synthesized
by the baseline model, pix2pix. Besides, for MR brain image synthesis, it is
important to preserve the critical tumor information in the generated
modalities, so we further introduce a multi-modality tumor consistency loss to
MGAN, called TC-MGAN. We use the synthesized modalities by TC-MGAN to boost the
tumor segmentation accuracy, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness.","['Bingyu Xin', 'Yifan Hu', 'Yefeng Zheng', 'Hongen Liao']",2020-05-02T21:33:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00925v1

the deformation fields estimated from both: (i) the translated MR image and

how to fuse them to achieve better registration performance. The multimodal

Outdoor Position Recovery from HeterogeneousTelco Cellular Data,"Recent years have witnessed unprecedented amounts of data generated by
telecommunication (Telco) cellular networks. For example, measurement records
(MRs) are generated to report the connection states between mobile devices and
Telco networks, e.g., received signal strength. MR data have been widely used
to localize outdoor mobile devices for human mobility analysis, urban planning,
and traffic forecasting. Existing works using first-order sequence models such
as the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) attempt to capture spatio-temporal locality in
underlying mobility patterns for lower localization errors. The HMM approaches
typically assume stable mobility patterns of the underlying mobile devices. Yet
real MR datasets exhibit heterogeneous mobility patterns due to mixed
transportation modes of the underlying mobile devices and uneven distribution
of the positions associated with MR samples. Thus, the existing solutions
cannot handle these heterogeneous mobility patterns. we propose a multi-task
learning-based deep neural network (DNN) framework, namely PRNet+, to
incorporate outdoor position recovery and transportation mode detection. To
make sure the framework work, PRNet+ develops a feature extraction module to
precisely learn local-, short- and long-term spatio-temporal locality from

Velocity-aware Antenna Selection in Predictor Antenna Systems,"Moving relay (MR), which is a candidate solution for supporting in-vehicle

of an MR, one can use predictor antenna (PA), i.e., an additional antenna in
front of the receive antenna (RA), to obtain CSIT, and recent works have
investigated the benefits of such a set up. PA-aided CSIT acquisition normally
works with the help of different content information such as the location and
the velocity of the MR. In this paper, we study the effect of velocity
awareness on the PA system, and develop adaptive antenna selection schemes in
PA-assisted MRs. Results show that, compared to no-CSIT schemes, a

"Nonreciprocal Nature and induced Tunneling Barrier Modulation in Chiral
  Molecular Devices","The chirality-spin interaction is a fascinating topic for physicists and
chemists. For example, chiral molecules like DNA generate giant spin
polarization in nanodevices characterized by large magnetoresistance (MR). This
phenomenon, called chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), paves pathways
for unconventional spintronic devices and enantiomer separation. Different from
ordinary transport, CISS MR violates Onsager's reciprocal relation and its
physical mechanism is elusive and debated. In this work, we propose that the
CISS MR is intimately related to the electric magnetochiral anisotropy (EMCA)
while EMCA respects Onsager's relation. EMCA generates extra charge trapping in
the device and modifies the electron tunneling barrier that alters the
tunneling resistance sensitively, circumventing the Onsager's reciprocity. Our
theory reveals the intimate connection between EMCA and CISS MR and explains
the unusually large MR ratio by the nonlinear tunneling transport, which is
related to the induced spin polarization indirectly. We provide a tunneling
barrier model to extract the barrier modulation from available experimental
results. Our work provides a deep understanding of the CISS transport by
characterizing the tunneling barrier and further linking it to another quantity
measured in recent experiments, the surface potential.","['Jiewen Xiao', 'Yufei Zhao', 'Binghai Yan']",2022-01-10T20:10:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03623v3

MI-driven MRs intermittently occur with moving the location of the reconnection

electrons, which are accelerated by MI-driven MRs, increases with time in the
region inside the initial velocity-shear surface with accompanying the
generation and subsequent amplification of magnetic fields by MI. The maximum

Cross-Modality High-Frequency Transformer for MR Image Super-Resolution,"Improving the resolution of magnetic resonance (MR) image data is critical to
computer-aided diagnosis and brain function analysis. Higher resolution helps
to capture more detailed content, but typically induces to lower
signal-to-noise ratio and longer scanning time. To this end, MR image
super-resolution has become a widely-interested topic in recent times. Existing
works establish extensive deep models with the conventional architectures based
on convolutional neural networks (CNN). In this work, to further advance this
research field, we make an early effort to build a Transformer-based MR image
super-resolution framework, with careful designs on exploring valuable domain
prior knowledge. Specifically, we consider two-fold domain priors including the
high-frequency structure prior and the inter-modality context prior, and
establish a novel Transformer architecture, called Cross-modality
high-frequency Transformer (Cohf-T), to introduce such priors into
super-resolving the low-resolution (LR) MR images. Experiments on two datasets
indicate that Cohf-T achieves new state-of-the-art performance.","['Chaowei Fang', 'Dingwen Zhang', 'Liang Wang', 'Yulun Zhang', 'Lechao Cheng', 'Junwei Han']",2022-03-29T07:56:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15314v2
Deep Learning-Based MR Image Re-parameterization,"Magnetic resonance (MR) image re-parameterization refers to the process of
generating via simulations of an MR image with a new set of MRI scanning
parameters. Different parameter values generate distinct contrast between
different tissues, helping identify pathologic tissue. Typically, more than one
scan is required for diagnosis; however, acquiring repeated scans can be
costly, time-consuming, and difficult for patients. Thus, using MR image
re-parameterization to predict and estimate the contrast in these imaging scans
can be an effective alternative. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
(DL) based convolutional model for MRI re-parameterization. Based on our
preliminary results, DL-based techniques hold the potential to learn the
non-linearities that govern the re-parameterization.","['Abhijeet Narang', 'Abhigyan Raj', 'Mihaela Pop', 'Mehran Ebrahimi']",2022-06-11T12:39:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05516v2
"Interferometric cavity ring-down technique for ultra-high Q-factor
  microresonators","Microresonators (MRs) are key components in integrated optics. As a result,
the estimation of their energy storage capacity as measured by the quality
factor (Q) is crucial. However, in MR with high/ultra-high Q, the surface-wall
roughness dominates the intrinsic Q and generates a coupling between
counter-propagating modes. This splits the usual sharp single resonance and
makes difficult the use of classical methods to assess Q. Here, we
theoretically show that an interferometric excitation can be exploited in a
Cavity Ring-Down (CRD) method to measure the ultimate Q of a MR. In fact, under
suitable conditions, the resonant doublet merges into a single Lorentzian and
the time dynamics of the MR assumes the usual behavior of a single-mode
resonator unaffected by backscattering. This allows obtaining a typical
exponential decay in the charging and discharging time of the MR, and thus,
estimating its ultimate Q by measuring the photon lifetime.","['Stefano Biasi', 'Riccardo Franchi', 'Lorenzo Pavesi']",2022-06-16T12:36:11Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08123v1
"Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality Measurement Under Different
  Environments: A Survey on Head-Mounted Devices","Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) have been two of the most
explosive research topics in the last few years. Head-Mounted Devices (HMDs)
are essential intermediums for using AR and MR technology, playing an important
role in the research progress in these two areas. Behavioral research with
users is one way of evaluating the technical progress and effectiveness of
HMDs. In addition, AR and MR technology is dependent upon virtual interactions
with the real environment. Thus, conditions in real environments can be a
significant factor for AR and MR measurements with users. In this paper, we
survey 87 environmental-related HMD papers with measurements from users,
spanning over 32 years. We provide a thorough review of AR- and MR-related user
experiments with HMDs under different environmental factors. Then, we summarize
trends in this literature over time using a new classification method with four
environmental factors, the presence or absence of user feedback in behavioral
experiments, and ten main categories to subdivide these papers (e.g., domain
and method of user assessment). We also categorize characteristics of the
behavioral experiments, showing similarities and differences among papers.","['Hung-Jui Guo', 'Jonathan Z. Bakdash', 'Laura R. Marusich', 'Balakrishnan Prabhakaran']",2022-10-29T02:03:56Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16463v1

low visual resolution, and imprecise input. Data physicalizations on the other
hand, although allowing for natural physical manipulation, are limited in
dynamic and interactive modification. We demonstrate how mobile devices such as
smartphones or tablets can serve as physical proxies for MR data interactions,
creating dynamic visualizations that support precise manipulation and rich
input and output. We describe 6 interaction techniques that leverage the
combined physicality, sensing, and output capabilities of HMDs and smartphones,

"A Secure Medical Record Sharing Scheme Based on Blockchain and Two-fold
  Encryption","Usually, a medical record (MR) contains the patients disease-oriented
sensitive information. In addition, the MR needs to be shared among different
bodies, e.g., diagnostic centres, hospitals, physicians, etc. Hence, retaining
the privacy and integrity of MR is crucial. A blockchain based secure MR
sharing system can manage these aspects properly. This paper proposes a
blockchain based electronic (e-) MR sharing scheme that (i) considers the
medical image and the text as the input, (ii) enriches the data privacy through
a two-fold encryption mechanism consisting of an asymmetric cryptosystem and
the dynamic DNA encoding, (iii) assures data integrity by storing the encrypted
e-MR in the distinct block designated for each user in the blockchain, and (iv)
eventually, enables authorized entities to regain the e-MR through decryption.

Regular reflection to Mach reflection(RR-MR) transition in Short wedges,"Regular reflection (RR) to Mach reflection(MR) transitions (RR-MR) on long
wedges in steady supersonic flows have been well studied and documented.
However, in a short wedge where the wedge length is small, the transition
prediction becomes really challenging owing to the interaction of the expansion
fan emanating from the trailing edge of the wedge with the incident shock and
the triple/reflection point. The extent of this interaction depends on the
distance between the wedge trailing edge and the symmetry line (Ht). This
distance is a geometric combination of the distance of the wedge leading edge
from the symmetry line (H), the wedge angle, and the wedge length (w). In the
present work, the RR-MR transitions have been studied using analytical and
computational methods, and the transition lines are plotted for various Mach
numbers and wedge lengths. The transition criterion strongly depends on the
wedge length, which can be so adjusted to eliminate the RR-MR transitions till
the wedge angle reaches the no-reflection domain.","['Vinod Yeldho Baby', 'Vinoth Paramanantham', 'G Rajesh']",2023-06-13T06:40:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07568v2
"FedAutoMRI: Federated Neural Architecture Search for MR Image
  Reconstruction","Centralized training methods have shown promising results in MR image
reconstruction, but privacy concerns arise when gathering data from multiple
institutions. Federated learning, a distributed collaborative training scheme,
can utilize multi-center data without the need to transfer data between
institutions. However, existing federated learning MR image reconstruction
methods rely on manually designed models which have extensive parameters and
suffer from performance degradation when facing heterogeneous data
distributions. To this end, this paper proposes a novel FederAted neUral
archiTecture search approach fOr MR Image reconstruction (FedAutoMRI). The
proposed method utilizes differentiable architecture search to automatically
find the optimal network architecture. In addition, an exponential moving
average method is introduced to improve the robustness of the client model to
address the data heterogeneity issue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to use federated neural architecture search for MR image
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FedAutoMRI
can achieve promising performances while utilizing a lightweight model with
only a small number of model parameters compared to the classical federated

Variations on the two-child problem,"Mr. Smith has two children. Given that at least one of them is a boy, how
likely is it that Mr. Smith has two boys? It's a very standard puzzle in
elementary books on probability theory. Whoever asks you this question hopes
that you will answer ""$\frac{1}{2}$"", in which case they can say triumphantly
""Oh no, the answer is $\frac{1}{3}$"". This is called the two-child puzzle. Some
authors have discussed a striking variation, which we'll call the Adam puzzle.
Again, Mr. Smith has two children. Given that one of them is a boy named Adam,
how likely is it that Mr. Smith has two boys? Astonishingly, now the answer is
$\frac{1}{2}$, at least approximately. (The exact answer depends a bit on
precise assumptions.) We give pictorial explanations of both puzzles. We then
point out that the answers usually given rely on a tacit assumption about how
the information that one of Mr. Smith's two children is a boy, or one of them
is a boy named Adam, is obtained. We give examples showing that the answers may
be different with different assumptions. We conclude with a discussion of why

"Can ChatGPT advance software testing intelligence? An experience report
  on metamorphic testing","While ChatGPT is a well-known artificial intelligence chatbot being used to
answer human's questions, one may want to discover its potential in advancing
software testing. We examine the capability of ChatGPT in advancing the
intelligence of software testing through a case study on metamorphic testing
(MT), a state-of-the-art software testing technique. We ask ChatGPT to generate
candidates of metamorphic relations (MRs), which are basically necessary
properties of the object program and which traditionally require human
intelligence to identify. These MR candidates are then evaluated in terms of
correctness by domain experts. We show that ChatGPT can be used to generate new
correct MRs to test several software systems. Having said that, the majority of
MR candidates are either defined vaguely or incorrect, especially for systems
that have never been tested with MT. ChatGPT can be used to advance software
testing intelligence by proposing MR candidates that can be later adopted for
implementing tests; but human intelligence should still inevitably be involved
to justify and rectify their correctness.","['Quang-Hung Luu', 'Huai Liu', 'Tsong Yueh Chen']",2023-10-30T00:01:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19204v2
Automatically Generating Metamorphic Relations via Genetic Programming,"Metamorphic testing is a popular approach that aims to alleviate the oracle
problem in software testing. At the core of this approach are Metamorphic
Relations (MRs), specifying properties that hold among multiple test inputs and
corresponding outputs. Deriving MRs is mostly a manual activity, since their
automated generation is a challenging and largely unexplored problem.
  This paper presents GenMorph, a technique to automatically generate MRs for
Java methods that involve inputs and outputs that are boolean, numerical, or
ordered sequences. GenMorph uses an evolutionary algorithm to search for
effective test oracles, i.e., oracles that trigger no false alarms and expose
software faults in the method under test. The proposed search algorithm is
guided by two fitness functions that measure the number of false alarms and the
number of missed faults for the generated MRs.
  Our results show that GenMorph generates effective MRs for 18 out of 23
methods (mutation score >20%). Furthermore, it can increase Randoop's fault
detection capability in 7 out of 23 methods, and Evosuite's in 14 out of 23

"In-plane anisotropic magnetoresistance in detwinned
  $BaFe_{2-x}Ni_{x}As_{2}$ ($x$ = 0, 0.6)","Understanding the magnetoresistance (MR) of a magnetic material forms the
basis for uncovering the orbital mechanisms and charge-spin interactions in the
system. Although the parent state of iron-based high-temperature
superconductors, including $BaFe_2As_2$, exhibits unusual electron transport
properties resulting from spin and charge correlations, there is still valuable
insight to be gained by understanding the in-plane MR effect due to twin
domains in the orthorhombic antiferromagnetic (AF) ordered state. Here, we
study the in-plane magnetoresistance anisotropy in detwinned $BaFe_2As_2$ and
compare the results to the non-magnetic Ni-doped sample. We find that in the
antiferromagnetically ordered state, $BaFe_2As_2$ exhibits anisotropic MR that
becomes large at low temperatures and high fields. Both transverse and
longitudinal MRs are highly anisotropic and dependent on the field and current
orientations. These results cannot be fully explained by calculations
considering only the anisotropic Fermi surface. Instead, the spin orientation
of the ordered moment also affects the MR effect, suggesting the presence of a
large charge-spin interaction in $BaFe_2As_2$ that is not present in the
Ni-doped material.","['Kelly J. Neubauer', 'Mason L. Klemm', 'Shirin Mozaffari', 'Lin Jiao', 'Alexei E. Koshelev', 'Alexander Yaresko', 'Ming Yi', 'Luis Balicas', 'Pengcheng Dai']",2024-02-01T15:50:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00693v1
"Origin of giant magnetoresistance in layered nodal-line semimetal

interest due to their many exotic physical properties. In this paper, we
studied the magnetotransport properties of the exfoliated TaNiTe5, a recently
discovered Dirac nodal-line semimetal. A giant positive magnetoresistance (MR)
is observed when the current is parallel to the crystallographic c axis, while
it is strongly diminished when the current flows along the a axis. The observed
giant MR is gradually suppressed either on reducing the thickness of nanoflake
or on increasing temperature. By performing MR measurement in tilted magnetic
fields, the interlayer coupling is found to be weakened both by reducing the
thickness and by increasing temperature. We propose a mechanism of
electron-electron interaction-assisted interlayer transport as a origin of the
giant MR. The mechanism is likely to provide a explanation for the giant MR in
other layered materials.","['Ding-Bang Zhou', 'Kuang-Hong Gao', 'Meng-Fan Zhao', 'Zhi-Yan Jia', 'Xiao-Xia Hu', 'Qian-Jin Guo', 'Hai-Yan Du', 'Xiao-Ping Chen', 'Zhi-Qing Li']",2024-02-25T13:27:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16088v2

"Harms in Repurposing Real-World Sensory Cues for Mixed Reality: A Causal
  Perspective","The rise of Mixed Reality (MR) stimulates new interactive techniques that
seamlessly blend the virtual and physical environments. Just as virtual content
could be overlayed onto the physical world for providing adaptive user
interfaces [5, 8], emergent techniques ""repurpose"" everyday environments and
sensory cues to support the virtual content [7, 9, 13-15]. For instance, a
strong wind gust in the real world, rather than being distracting to the
virtual experience, can be mapped with trees swaying in MR to achieve a
unifying experience [15], as shown in Figure 1. Such techniques introduce
stronger immersion, but they also expose users to overlooked perceptual
manipulations, where safety risks arise from misperception of real-world
events. In this work, we apply a causal inference perspective to understand the
harms of repurposing real-world sensory cues for MR. We argue that by viewing
the MR experience as a causal inference process of interpreting cues arising
from both the virtual and physical world, MR designers and researchers can gain
a new lens to understand potential perceptual manipulation harms.","['Yujie Tao', 'Sean Follmer']",2024-04-23T17:34:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05931v1

Mid-range adiabatic wireless energy transfer via a mediator coil,"A technique for efficient mid-range wireless energy transfer between two
coils via a mediator coil is proposed. By varying the coil frequencies three
resonances are created: emitter-mediator (EM), mediator-receiver (MR) and
emitter-receiver (ER). If the frequency sweeps are adiabatic and such that the
ER resonance precedes the MR resonance, the energy flows sequentially along the
chain emitter-mediator-receiver. If the MR resonance precedes the ER resonance,
then the energy flows directly from the emitter to the receiver via the ER
resonance; then the losses from the mediator are suppressed. This technique is
robust to noise, resonant constraints and external interferences.","['Andon A. Rangelov', 'Nikolay V. Vitanov']",2012-01-22T19:28:39Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4592v1

  Fourier Samples","In this paper, the problem of Magnetic Resonance (MR) image reconstruction
from partial Fourier samples has been considered. To this aim, we leverage the
evidence that MR images are sparser than their zero-filled reconstructed ones
from incomplete Fourier samples. This information can be used to define an
optimization problem which searches for the sparsest possible image conforming
with the available Fourier samples. We solve the resulting problem using the
well-known Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Unlike most
existing methods that work with small over-lapping image patches, the proposed
algorithm considers the whole image without dividing it into small blocks.
Experimental results prominently confirm its promising performance and

we can manipulate the polarization and angular radiation of thermal emission of

"Conductance anisotropy and linear magnetoresistance in La2-xSrxCuO4 thin
  films","We have performed a detailed study of conductance anisotropy and
magnetoresistance (MR) of La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) thin films (0.10 < x < 0.25).
These two observables are promising for the detection of stripes. Subtle
features of the conductance anisotropy are revealed by measuring the transverse
resistance Rxy in zero magnetic field. It is demonstrated that the sign of Rxy
depends on the orientation of the LSCO Hall bar with respect to the terrace
structure of the substrate. Unit-cell-high substrate step edges must therefore
be a dominant nucleation source for antiphase boundaries during film growth. We
show that the measurement of Rxy is sensitive enough to detect the
cubic-tetragonal phase transition of the SrTiO3(100) (STO) substrate at 105 K.
The MR of LSCO thin films shows for 0.10 < x < 0.25 a non-monotonic temperature
dependence, resulting from the onset of a linear term in the MR above 90 K. We
show that the linear MR scales with the absolute Hall resistivity, with the
constant of proportionality independent of temperature. Such scaling suggests
that the linear MR originates from current distortions induced by structural or
electronic inhomogeneities. The possible role of stripes for both the MR and
the conductance anisotropy is discussed throughout the paper.","['M. van Zalk', 'A. Brinkman', 'H. Hilgenkamp']",2011-05-29T15:29:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.6090v1
Resolution-aware network coded storage,"In this paper, we show that coding can be used in storage area networks
(SANs) to improve various quality of service metrics under normal SAN operating
conditions, without requiring additional storage space. For our analysis, we
develop a model which captures modern characteristics such as constrained I/O
access bandwidth limitations. Using this model, we consider two important
cases: single-resolution (SR) and multi-resolution (MR) systems. For SR
systems, we use blocking probability as the quality of service metric and
propose the network coded storage (NCS) scheme as a way to reduce blocking
probability. The NCS scheme codes across file chunks in time, exploiting file
striping and file duplication. Under our assumptions, we illustrate cases where
SR NCS provides an order of magnitude savings in blocking probability. For MR
systems, we introduce saturation probability as a quality of service metric to
manage multiple user types, and we propose the uncoded resolution- aware
storage (URS) and coded resolution-aware storage (CRS) schemes as ways to
reduce saturation probability. In MR URS, we align our MR layout strategy with
traffic requirements. In MR CRS, we code videos across MR layers. Under our
assumptions, we illustrate that URS can in some cases provide an order of
magnitude gain in saturation probability over classic non-resolution aware
systems. Further, we illustrate that CRS provides additional saturation
probability savings over URS.","['Ulric J. Ferner', 'Tong Wang', 'Muriel Médard', 'Emina Soljanin']",2013-05-29T16:52:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6864v1
"Electrically tuned magnetic order and magnetoresistance in a topological
  insulator","The Dirac-like surface states of the topological insulators (TIs) are
protected by time reversal symmetry (TRS) and exhibit a host of novel
properties. Introducing magnetism into TI, which breaks the TRS, is expected to
create exotic topological magnetoelectric effects. A particularly intriguing
phenomenon in this case is the magnetic field dependence of electrical
resistance, or magnetoresistance (MR). The intricate interplay between
topological protection and broken-TRS may lead to highly unconventional MR
behaviour that can find unique applications in magnetic sensing and data
storage. However, so far the MR of TI with spontaneously broken TRS is still
poorly understood, mainly due to the lack of well-controlled experiments. In
this work, we investigate the magneto transport properties of a ferromagnetic
TI thin film fabricated into a field effect transistor device. We observe an
unusually complex evolution of MR when the Fermi level (EF) is tuned across the
Dirac point (DP) by gate voltage. In particular, MR tends to be positive when
EF lies close to the DP but becomes negative at higher energies. This trend is
opposite to that expected from the Berry phase picture for localization, but is
intimately correlated with the gate-tuned magnetic order. We show that the
underlying physics is the competition between the topology-induced weak
antilocalization and magnetism-induced negative MR. The simultaneous electrical
control of magnetic order and magneto transport facilitates future TI-based
spintronic devices.","['Zuocheng Zhang', 'Xiao Feng', 'Minghua Guo', 'Kang Li', 'Jinsong Zhang', 'Yunbo Ou', 'Yang Feng', 'Lili Wang', 'Xi Chen', 'Ke He', 'Xucun Ma', 'Qikun Xue', 'Yayu Wang']",2014-09-24T09:02:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6862v1
Robust linear magnetoresistance in WTe2,"Unsaturated magnetoresistance (MR) has been reported in WTe2, and remains
irrepressible up to very high field. Intense optimization of the crystalline
quality causes a squarely-increasing MR, as interpreted by perfect compensation
of opposite carriers. Herein we report our observation of linear MR (LMR) in
WTe2 crystals, the onset of which is first identified by constructing the
mobility spectra of the MR at low fields. The LMR further intensifies and
predominates at fields higher than 20 Tesla while the parabolic MR gradually
decays. The LMR remains unsaturated up to a high field of 60 Tesla and
persists, even at a high pressure of 6.2 GPa. Assisted by density functional
theory calculations and detailed mobility spectra, we find the LMR to be robust
against the applications of high field, broken carrier balance, and mobility
suppression. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals a unique
quasilinear energy dispersion near the Fermi level. Our results suggest that
the robust LMR is the low bound of the unsaturated MR in WTe2.","['Xing-Chen Pan', 'Yiming Pan', 'Juan Jiang', 'Huakun Zuo', 'Huimei Liu', 'Xuliang Chen', 'Zhongxia Wei', 'Shuai Zhang', 'Zhihe Wang', 'Xiangang Wan', 'Zhaorong Yang', 'Donglai Feng', 'Zhengcai Xia', 'Liang Li', 'Fengqi Song', 'Baigeng Wang', 'Yuheng Zhang', 'Guanghou Wang']",2015-05-29T09:34:38Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07968v1
"Magnetotransport properties of the type II Weyl semimetal candidate
  Ta3S2","We have investigated the magnetoresistance (MR) and Hall resistivity
properties of the single crystals of tantalum sulfide, Ta3S2, which was
recently predicted to be a new type II Weyl semimetal. Large MR (up to ~8000%
at 2 K and 16 T), field-induced metal-insulator-like transition and nonlinear
Hall resistivity are observed at low temperatures. The large MR shows a strong
dependence on the field orientation, leading to a giant anisotropic
magnetoresistance (AMR) effect. For the field applied along the b-axis (B//b),
MR exhibits quadratic field dependence at low fields and tends towards
saturation at high fields; while for B//a, MR presents quadratic field
dependence at low fields and becomes linear at high fields without any trend
towards saturation. The analysis of the Hall resistivity data indicates the
coexistence of a large number of electrons with low mobility and a small number
of holes with high mobility. Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillation analysis
reveals three fundamental frequencies originated from the three-dimensional

"Coronal condensations caused by magnetic reconnection between solar
  coronal loops","Employing Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
multi-wavelength images, we report the coronal condensation during the magnetic
reconnection (MR) between a system of open and closed coronal loops.
Higher-lying magnetically open structures, observed in AIA 171 A images above
the solar limb, move downward and interact with the lower-lying closed loops,
resulting in the formation of dips in the former. An X-type structure forms at
the interface. The interacting loops reconnect and disappear. Two sets of
newly-reconnected loops then form and recede from the MR region. During the MR
process, bright emission appears sequentially in the AIA 131 A and 304 A
channels repeatedly in the dips of higher-lying open structures. This indicates
the cooling and condensation process of hotter plasma from ~0.9 MK down to ~0.6
MK, and then to ~0.05 MK, also supported by the light curves of the AIA 171 A,
131 A, and 304 A channels. The part of higher-lying open structures supporting
the condensations participate in the successive MR. The condensations without
support by underlying loops then rain back to the solar surface along the
newly-reconnected loops. Our results suggest that the MR between coronal loops
leads to the condensation of hotter coronal plasma and its downflows. MR thus
plays an active role in the mass cycle of coronal plasma because it can
initiate the catastrophic cooling and condensation. This underlines that the
magnetic and thermal evolution has to be treated together and cannot be
separated, even in the case of catastrophic cooling.","['Leping Li', 'Jun Zhang', 'Hardi Peter', 'Lakshmi Pradeep Chitta', 'Jiangtao Su', 'Chun Xia', 'Hongqiang Song', 'Yijun Hou']",2018-08-29T03:38:16Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09626v1
"Alternating Segmentation and Simulation for Contrast Adaptive Tissue
  Classification","A key feature of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is its ability to manipulate
how the intrinsic tissue parameters of the anatomy ultimately contribute to the
contrast properties of the final, acquired image. This flexibility, however,
can lead to substantial challenges for segmentation algorithms, particularly
supervised methods. These methods require atlases or training data, which are
composed of MR image and labeled image pairs. In most cases, the training data
are obtained with a fixed acquisition protocol, leading to suboptimal
performance when an input data set that requires segmentation has differing
contrast properties. This drawback is increasingly significant with the recent
movement towards multi-center research studies involving multiple scanners and
acquisition protocols. In this work, we propose a new framework for supervised
segmentation approaches that is robust to contrast differences between the
training MR image and the input image. Our approach uses a generative
simulation model within the segmentation process to compensate for the contrast
differences. We allow the contrast of the MR image in the training data to vary
by simulating a new contrast from the corresponding label image. The model
parameters are optimized by a cost function measuring the consistency between
the input MR image and its simulation based on a current estimate of the
segmentation labels. We provide a proof of concept of this approach by
combining a supervised classifier with a simple simulation model, and apply the
resulting algorithm to synthetic images and actual MR images.","['Dzung L. Pham', 'Snehashis Roy']",2018-11-17T03:28:50Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07087v1
"Fault Detection Effectiveness of Metamorphic Relations Developed for
  Testing Supervised Classifiers","In machine learning, supervised classifiers are used to obtain predictions
for unlabeled data by inferring prediction functions using labeled data.
Supervised classifiers are widely applied in domains such as computational
biology, computational physics and healthcare to make critical decisions.
However, it is often hard to test supervised classifiers since the expected
answers are unknown. This is commonly known as the \emph{oracle problem} and
metamorphic testing (MT) has been used to test such programs. In MT,
metamorphic relations (MRs) are developed from intrinsic characteristics of the
software under test (SUT). These MRs are used to generate test data and to
verify the correctness of the test results without the presence of a test
oracle. Effectiveness of MT heavily depends on the MRs used for testing. In
this paper we have conducted an extensive empirical study to evaluate the fault
detection effectiveness of MRs that have been used in multiple previous studies
to test supervised classifiers. Our study uses a total of 709 reachable mutants
generated by multiple mutation engines and uses data sets with varying
characteristics to test the SUT. Our results reveal that only 14.8\% of these
mutants are detected using the MRs and that the fault detection effectiveness
of these MRs do not scale with the increased number of mutants when compared to
what was reported in previous studies.","['Prashanta Saha', 'Upulee Kanewala']",2019-04-15T22:23:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07348v1
"Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via CycleGAN for White Matter
  Hyperintensity Segmentation in Multicenter MR Images","Automatic segmentation of white matter hyperintensities in magnetic resonance
images is of paramount clinical and research importance. Quantification of
these lesions serve as a predictor for risk of stroke, dementia and mortality.
During the last years, convolutional neural networks (CNN) specifically
tailored for biomedical image segmentation have outperformed all previous
techniques in this task. However, they are extremely data-dependent, and
maintain a good performance only when data distribution between training and
test datasets remains unchanged. When such distribution changes but we still
aim at performing the same task, we incur in a domain adaptation problem (e.g.
using a different MR machine or different acquisition parameters for training
and test data). In this work, we explore the use of cycle-consistent
adversarial networks (CycleGAN) to perform unsupervised domain adaptation on
multicenter MR images with brain lesions. We aim at learning a mapping function
to transform volumetric MR images between domains, which are characterized by
different medical centers and MR machines with varying brand, model and
configuration parameters. Our experiments show that CycleGAN allows us to
reduce the Jensen-Shannon divergence between MR domains, enabling automatic
segmentation with CNN models on domains where no labeled data was available.","['Julian Alberto Palladino', 'Diego Fernandez Slezak', 'Enzo Ferrante']",2020-09-10T16:48:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04985v1

Pr$_{2}$Ba$_{4}$Cu$_{7}$O$_{15-\delta }$ at low temperatures (1.8-40 K) under
various magnetic fields (up to 14 T). In the as-sintered non-superconducting
sample, the magneto-resistance (MR) follows a power law of $H^{3/2}$ at low
temperatures, which is in no agreement with the $H^{2}$ dependence of MR in the
PrBa$_{2}$Cu$_{4}$O$_{8}$ system. The negative pressure dependence of the
superconducting phase is qualitatively consistent with a theoretical prediction
on the basis of the Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid theory. The 48-h-reduced
superconducting sample at ambient pressure exhibits no clear increase in MR for
$T > T_{c,on}=26.5$ K. In contrast, with the application of pressure to the
superconducting sample, the MR effects reappear and are also well fitted by
$H^{3/2}$. The model of slightly warped Fermi surfaces explains not only the MR
effect of the non-superconducting sample, but is also related to the reasons
for the pressure-induced MR phenomena of the superconducting sample.","['Masayoshi Kuwabara', 'Michiaki Matsukawa', 'Keisuke Sugawara', 'Haruka Taniguchi']",2016-09-01T07:01:01Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00125v1
"Observation of Magnetic reconnection at a 3D null point associated with
  a solar eruption","Magnetic null has long been recognized as a special structure serving as a
preferential site for magnetic reconnection (MR). However, the direct
observational study of MR at null-points is largely lacking. Here, we show the
observations of MR around a magnetic null associated with an eruption that
resulted in an M1.7 flare and a coronal mass ejection. The GOES X- ray profile
of the flare exhibited two peaks at 02:23 UT and 02:40 UT on 2012 November 8,
respectively. Based on the imaging observations, we find that the first and
also primary X- ray peak was originated from MR in the current sheet underneath
the erupting magnetic flux rope (MFR). On the other hand, the second and also
weaker X-ray peak was caused by MR around a null-point located above the
pre-eruption MFR. The interaction of the null-point and the erupting MFR can be
described as a two-step process. During the first step, the erupting and fast
expanding MFR passed through the null-point, resulting in a significant
displacement of the magnetic field surrounding the null. During the second
step, the displaced magnetic field started to move back, resulting in a
converging inflow and subsequently the MR around the null. The null-point
reconnection is a different process from the current sheet reconnection in this
flare; the latter is the cause of the main peak of the flare, while the former
is the cause of the secondary peak of the flare and the conspicuous high-lying
cusp structure.","['J. Q. Sun', 'J. Zhang', 'K. Yang', 'X. Cheng', 'M. D. Ding']",2016-09-22T00:40:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06787v2
"First-principles study on magnetic tunneling junctions with
  semiconducting CuInSe${}_{2}$ and CuGaSe${}_{2}$ barriers","We theoretically investigate two different magnetic tunneling junctions
(MTJs) with semiconductor barriers, CuInSe${}_{2}$ (CIS) and CuGaSe${}_{2}$
(CGS), which are the terminal compounds of recently reported mixed
semiconductor barrier, CuIn${}_{1-x}$Ga$_{\it x}$Se${}_{2}$. To discuss the
transport properties of these systems, we analyze complex band structures,
magnetoresistance (MR) ratios, and resistance-area products ($RA$) by using
first-principles based calculations in combination with the Landauer formula.
It is found that the $\Delta_{1}$ wave functions have dominant contributions to
the spin-dependent tunneling transport in both CIS- and CGS-based MTJs. We also
find that the CGS-based MTJ has a much larger MR ratio and slightly higher $RA$
than those of the CIS-based MTJ, which indicates that a larger MR ratio is
expected for a higher Ga concentration $x$ in the
CuIn${}_{1-x}$Ga${}_{x}$Se${}_{2}$-based MTJs. We further study the
relationship between the band gaps in the barriers and MR ratios by changing
the Coulomb repulsions in the Cu 3$d$ states of the CIS and CGS. It is shown
that the barrier with a larger band gap yields a larger MR ratio. The
comparison of MR ratios and $RA$ between the CIS-, CGS-, and MgO-based MTJs are
also given.","['Keisuke Masuda', 'Yoshio Miura']",2016-09-25T08:22:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07713v3
"3D Global Convolutional Adversarial Network\\ for Prostate MR Volume
  Segmentation","Advanced deep learning methods have been developed to conduct prostate MR
volume segmentation in either a 2D or 3D fully convolutional manner. However,
2D methods tend to have limited segmentation performance, since large amounts
of spatial information of prostate volumes are discarded during the
slice-by-slice segmentation process; and 3D methods also have room for
improvement, since they use isotropic kernels to perform 3D convolutions
whereas most prostate MR volumes have anisotropic spatial resolution. Besides,
the fully convolutional structural methods achieve good performance for
localization issues but neglect the per-voxel classification for segmentation
tasks. In this paper, we propose a 3D Global Convolutional Adversarial Network
(3D GCA-Net) to address efficient prostate MR volume segmentation. We first
design a 3D ResNet encoder to extract 3D features from prostate scans, and then
develop the decoder, which is composed of a multi-scale 3D global convolutional
block and a 3D boundary refinement block, to address the classification and
localization issues simultaneously for volumetric segmentation. Additionally,
we combine the encoder-decoder segmentation network with an adversarial network
in the training phrase to enforce the contiguity of long-range spatial
predictions. Throughout the proposed model, we use anisotropic convolutional
processing for better feature learning on prostate MR scans. We evaluated our
3D GCA-Net model on two public prostate MR datasets and achieved
state-of-the-art performances.","['Haozhe Jia', 'Yang Song', 'Donghao Zhang', 'Heng Huang', 'Dagan Feng', 'Michael Fulham', 'Yong Xia', 'Weidong Cai']",2018-07-18T02:27:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06742v1
"MANTIS: Model-Augmented Neural neTwork with Incoherent k-space Sampling
  for efficient MR T2 mapping","Quantitative mapping of magnetic resonance (MR) parameters have been shown as
valuable methods for improved assessment of a range of diseases. Due to the
need to image an anatomic structure multiple times, parameter mapping usually
requires long scan times compared to conventional static imaging. Therefore,
accelerated parameter mapping is highly-desirable and remains a topic of great
interest in the MR research community. While many recent deep learning methods
have focused on highly efficient image reconstruction for conventional static
MR imaging, applications of deep learning for dynamic imaging and in particular
accelerated parameter mapping have been limited. The purpose of this work was
to develop and evaluate a novel deep learning-based reconstruction framework
called Model-Augmented Neural neTwork with Incoherent k-space Sampling (MANTIS)
for efficient MR parameter mapping. Our approach combines end-to-end CNN
mapping with k-space consistency using the concept of cyclic loss to further
enforce data and model fidelity. Incoherent k-space sampling is used to improve
reconstruction performance. A physical model is incorporated into the proposed
framework, so that the parameter maps can be efficiently estimated directly
from undersampled images. The performance of MANTIS was demonstrated for the
spin-spin relaxation time (T2) mapping of the knee joint. Compared to
conventional reconstruction approaches that exploited image sparsity, MANTIS
yielded lower errors and higher similarity with respect to the reference in the
T2 estimation. Our study demonstrated that the proposed MANTIS framework, with
a combination of end-to-end CNN mapping, signal model-augmented data
consistency, and incoherent k-space sampling, represents a promising approach
for efficient MR parameter mapping. MANTIS can potentially be extended to other
types of parameter mapping with appropriate models.","['Fang Liu', 'Li Feng', 'Richard Kijowski']",2018-09-02T21:43:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03308v1
"Anisotropic Super Resolution in Prostate MRI using Super Resolution
  Generative Adversarial Networks","Acquiring High Resolution (HR) Magnetic Resonance (MR) images requires the
patient to remain still for long periods of time, which causes patient
discomfort and increases the probability of motion induced image artifacts. A
possible solution is to acquire low resolution (LR) images and to process them
with the Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) to create a
super-resolved version. This work applies SRGAN to MR images of the prostate
and performs three experiments. The first experiment explores improving the
in-plane MR image resolution by factors of 4 and 8, and shows that, while the
PSNR and SSIM (Structural SIMilarity) metrics are lower than the isotropic
bicubic interpolation baseline, the SRGAN is able to create images that have
high edge fidelity. The second experiment explores anisotropic super-resolution
via synthetic images, in that the input images to the network are
anisotropically downsampled versions of HR images. This experiment demonstrates
the ability of the modified SRGAN to perform anisotropic super-resolution, with
quantitative image metrics that are comparable to those of the anisotropic
bicubic interpolation baseline. Finally, the third experiment applies a
modified version of the SRGAN to super-resolve anisotropic images obtained from
the through-plane slices of the volumetric MR data. The output super-resolved
images contain a significant amount of high frequency information that make
them visually close to their HR counterparts. Overall, the promising results
from each experiment show that super-resolution for MR images is a successful
technique and that producing isotropic MR image volumes from anisotropic slices
is an achievable goal.","['Rewa Sood', 'Mirabela Rusu']",2019-12-19T19:05:18Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09497v1
"The effect of realistic geometries on the susceptibility-weighted MR
  signal in white matter","Purpose: To investigate the effect of realistic microstructural geometry on
the susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) signal in white matter
(WM), with application to demyelination.
  Methods: Previous work has modeled susceptibility-weighted signals under the
assumption that axons are cylindrical. In this work, we explore the
implications of this assumption by considering the effect of more realistic
geometries. A three-compartment WM model incorporating relevant properties
based on literature was used to predict the MR signal. Myelinated axons were
modeled with several cross-sectional geometries of increasing realism: nested
circles, warped/elliptical circles and measured axonal geometries from electron
micrographs. Signal simulations from the different microstructural geometries
were compared to measured signals from a Cuprizone mouse model with varying
degrees of demyelination.
  Results: Results from simulation suggest that axonal geometry affects the MR
signal. Predictions with realistic models were significantly different compared
to circular models under the same microstructural tissue properties, for
simulations with and without diffusion.
  Conclusion: The geometry of axons affects the MR signal significantly.
Literature estimates of myelin susceptibility, which are based on fitting
biophysical models to the MR signal, are likely to be biased by the assumed
geometry, as will any derived microstructural properties.","['Tianyou Xu', 'Sean Foxley', 'Michiel Kleinnijenhuis', 'Way Cherng Chen', 'Karla L Miller']",2017-03-08T12:47:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02817v1
Deep CT to MR Synthesis using Paired and Unpaired Data,"MR imaging will play a very important role in radiotherapy treatment planning
for segmentation of tumor volumes and organs. However, the use of MR-based
radiotherapy is limited because of the high cost and the increased use of metal
implants such as cardiac pacemakers and artificial joints in aging society. To
improve the accuracy of CT-based radiotherapy planning, we propose a synthetic
approach that translates a CT image into an MR image using paired and unpaired
training data. In contrast to the current synthetic methods for medical images,
which depend on sparse pairwise-aligned data or plentiful unpaired data, the
proposed approach alleviates the rigid registration challenge of paired
training and overcomes the context-misalignment problem of the unpaired
training. A generative adversarial network was trained to transform 2D brain CT
image slices into 2D brain MR image slices, combining adversarial loss, dual
cycle-consistent loss, and voxel-wise loss. The experiments were analyzed using
CT and MR images of 202 patients. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons
against independent paired training and unpaired training methods demonstrate
the superiority of our approach.","['Cheng-Bin Jin', 'Hakil Kim', 'Wonmo Jung', 'Seongsu Joo', 'Ensik Park', 'Ahn Young Saem', 'In Ho Han', 'Jae Il Lee', 'Xuenan Cui']",2018-05-28T07:14:05Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10790v2
Statistical Methods in Computed Tomography Image Estimation,"Purpose: There is increasing interest in computed tomography (CT) image
estimations from magnetic resonance (MR) images. The estimated CT images can be
utilised for attenuation correction, patient positioning, and dose planning in
diagnostic and radiotherapy workflows. This study aims to introduce a novel
statistical learning approach for improving CT estimation from MR images and to
compare the performance of our method with the existing model based CT image
estimation methods.
  Methods: The statistical learning approach proposed here consists of two
stages. At the training stage, prior knowledges about tissue-types from CT
images were used together with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to explore CT
image estimations from MR images. Since the prior knowledges are not available
at the prediction stage, a classifier based on RUSBoost algorithm was trained
to estimate the tissue-types from MR images. For a new patient, the trained
classifier and GMMs were used to predict CT image from MR images. The
classifier and GMMs were validated by using voxel level 10-fold
cross-validation and patient-level leave-one-out cross-validation,
respectively.
  Results: The proposed approach has outperformance in CT estimation quality in
comparison with the existing model based methods, especially on bone tissues.
Our method improved CT image estimation by 5% and 23% on the whole brain and
bone tissues, respectively.
  Conclusions: Evaluation of our method shows that it is a promising method to
generate CT image substitutes for the implementation of fully MR-based
radiotherapy and PET/MRI applications.","['Fekadu L. Bayisa', 'Xijia Liu', 'Anders Garpebring', 'Jun Yu']",2018-05-28T18:42:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11126v2
SUSAN: Segment Unannotated image Structure using Adversarial Network,"Segmentation of magnetic resonance (MR) images is a fundamental step in many
medical imaging-based applications. The recent implementation of deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image processing has been shown to have
significant impacts on medical image segmentation. Network training of
segmentation CNNs typically requires images and paired annotation data
representing pixel-wise tissue labels referred to as masks. However, the
supervised training of highly efficient CNNs with deeper structure and more
network parameters requires a large number of training images and paired tissue
masks. Thus, there is great need to develop a generalized CNN-based
segmentation method which would be applicable for a wide variety of MR image
datasets with different tissue contrasts. The purpose of this study was to
develop and evaluate a generalized CNN-based method for fully-automated
segmentation of different MR image datasets using a single set of annotated
training data. A technique called cycle-consistent generative adversarial
network (CycleGAN) is applied as the core of the proposed method to perform
image-to-image translation between MR image datasets with different tissue
contrasts. A joint segmentation network is incorporated into the adversarial
network to obtain additional segmentation functionality. The proposed method
was evaluated for segmenting bone and cartilage on two clinical knee MR image
datasets acquired at our institution using only a single set of annotated data
from a publicly available knee MR image dataset. The new technique may further
improve the applicability and efficiency of CNN-based segmentation of medical
images while eliminating the need for large amounts of annotated training data.",['Fang Liu'],2018-12-03T05:00:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00555v1
"Compressed Domain Image Classification Using a Dynamic-Rate Neural
  Network","Compressed domain image classification performs classification directly on
compressive measurements acquired from the single-pixel camera, bypassing the
image reconstruction step. It is of great importance for extending high-speed
object detection and classification beyond the visible spectrum in a
cost-effective manner especially for resource-limited platforms. Previous
neural network methods require training a dedicated neural network for each
different measurement rate (MR), which is costly in computation and storage. In
this work, we develop an efficient training scheme that provides a neural
network with dynamic-rate property, where a single neural network is capable of
classifying over any MR within the range of interest with a given sensing
matrix. This training scheme uses only a few selected MRs for training and the
trained neural network is valid over the full range of MRs of interest. We
demonstrate the performance of the dynamic-rate neural network on datasets of
MNIST, CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, COIL-100, and show that it generates
approximately equal performance at each MR as that of a single-rate neural
network valid only for one MR. Robustness to noise of the dynamic-rate model is
also demonstrated. The dynamic-rate training scheme can be regarded as a
general approach compatible with different types of sensing matrices, various
neural network architectures, and is a valuable step towards wider adoption of
compressive inference techniques and other compressive sensing related tasks
via neural networks.","['Yibo Xu', 'Weidi Liu', 'Kevin F. Kelly']",2019-01-28T20:16:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09983v2
"Coexistence of orbital and quantum critical magnetoresistance in
  FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$","The recent discovery of a non-magnetic nematic quantum critical point (QCP)
in the iron chalcogenide family FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ has raised the prospect of
investigating, in isolation, the role of nematicity on the electronic
properties of correlated metals. Here we report a detailed study of the normal
state transverse magnetoresistance (MR) in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ for a series of
S concentrations spanning the nematic QCP. For all temperatures and
\textit{x}-values studied, the MR can be decomposed into two distinct
components: one that varies quadratically in magnetic field strength
$\mu_{0}\textit{H}$ and one that follows precisely the quadrature scaling form
recently reported in metals at or close to a QCP and characterized by a
\textit{H}-linear MR over an extended field range. The two components evolve
systematically with both temperature and S-substitution in a manner that is
determined by their proximity to the nematic QCP. This study thus reveals
unambiguously the coexistence of two independent charge sectors in a quantum
critical system. Moreover, the quantum critical component of the MR is found to
be less sensitive to disorder than the quadratic (orbital) MR, suggesting that
detection of the latter in previous MR studies of metals near a QCP may have
been obscured.","['S. Licciardello', 'N. Maksimovic', 'J. Ayres', 'J. Buhot', 'M. Culo', 'B. Bryant', 'S. Kasahara', 'Y. Matsuda', 'T. Shibauchi', 'V. Nagarajan', 'J. G. Analytis', 'N. E. Hussey']",2019-03-13T18:55:15Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05679v1
"Single-parameter scaling in the magnetoresistance of optimally doped
  La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$","We show that the recent magnetoresistance data on thin-film
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ (LSCO) in strong magnetic fields ($B$) obeys a
single-parameter scaling of the form MR$(B,T)=f(\mu_H(T)B)$, where
$\mu_H^{-1}(T)\sim T^{\alpha}$ ($1\le\alpha\le2$), from $T=180$K until
$T\sim20$K, at which point the single-parameter scaling breaks down. The
functional form of the MR is distinct from the simple quadratic-to-linear
quadrature combination of temperature and magnetic field found in the optimally
doped iron superconductor BaFe${}_2$(As${}_{1-x}$P${}_x$)${}_2$. Further,
low-temperature departure of the MR in LSCO from its high-temperature scaling
law leads us to conclude that the MR curve collapse is not the result of
quantum critical scaling. We examine the classical effective medium theory
(EMT) previously used to obtain the quadrature resistivity dependence on field
and temperature for metals with a $T$-linear zero-field resistivity. It appears
that this scaling form results only for a binary, random distribution of
metallic components. More generally, we find a low-temperature, high-field
region where the resistivity is simultaneously $T$ and $B$ linear when multiple
metallic components are present. Our findings indicate that if mesoscopic
disorder is relevant to the magnetoresistance in strange metal materials, the
binary-distribution model which seems to be relevant to the iron pnictides is
distinct from the more broad-continuous distributions relevant to the cuprates.
Using the latter, we examine the applicability of classical effective medium
theory to the MR in LSCO and compare calculated MR curves with the experimental
data.","['Christian Boyd', 'Philip W. Phillips']",2019-05-07T18:00:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02737v1
"Automated Multi-sequence Cardiac MRI Segmentation Using Supervised
  Domain Adaptation","Left ventricle segmentation and morphological assessment are essential for
improving diagnosis and our understanding of cardiomyopathy, which in turn is
imperative for reducing risk of myocardial infarctions in patients.
Convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods for cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) image segmentation rely on supervision with pixel-level annotations, and
may not generalize well to images from a different domain. These methods are
typically sensitive to variations in imaging protocols and data acquisition.
Since annotating multi-sequence CMR images is tedious and subject to inter- and
intra-observer variations, developing methods that can automatically adapt from
one domain to the target domain is of great interest. In this paper, we propose
an approach for domain adaptation in multi-sequence CMR segmentation task using
transfer learning that combines multi-source image information. We first train
an encoder-decoder CNN on T2-weighted and balanced-Steady State Free Precession
(bSSFP) MR images with pixel-level annotation and fine-tune the same network
with a limited number of Late Gadolinium Enhanced-MR (LGE-MR) subjects, to
adapt the domain features. The domain-adapted network was trained with just
four LGE-MR training samples and obtained an average Dice score of $\sim$85.0\%
on the test set comprises of 40 LGE-MR subjects. The proposed method
significantly outperformed a network without adaptation trained from scratch on
the same set of LGE-MR training data.","['Sulaiman Vesal', 'Nishant Ravikumar', 'Andreas Maier']",2019-08-21T07:16:07Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07726v1
"Structurally aware bidirectional unpaired image to image translation
  between CT and MR","Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging and Computed Tomography (CT) are the primary
diagnostic imaging modalities quite frequently used for surgical planning and
analysis. A general problem with medical imaging is that the acquisition
process is quite expensive and time-consuming. Deep learning techniques like
generative adversarial networks (GANs) can help us to leverage the possibility
of an image to image translation between multiple imaging modalities, which in
turn helps in saving time and cost. These techniques will help to conduct
surgical planning under CT with the feedback of MRI information. While previous
studies have shown paired and unpaired image synthesis from MR to CT, image
synthesis from CT to MR still remains a challenge, since it involves the
addition of extra tissue information. In this manuscript, we have implemented
two different variations of Generative Adversarial Networks exploiting the
cycling consistency and structural similarity between both CT and MR image
modalities on a pelvis dataset, thus facilitating a bidirectional exchange of
content and style between these image modalities. The proposed GANs translate
the input medical images by different mechanisms, and hence generated images
not only appears realistic but also performs well across various comparison
metrics, and these images have also been cross verified with a radiologist. The
radiologist verification has shown that slight variations in generated MR and

solve the evacuation problem under several conditions. We consider a
rectangular field surrounded by walls with at least one exit. Our results show
that two modules are necessary and sufficient for evacuation from any
rectangular field if equipped with a global compass, which provides the modules
with a common sense of direction. After that, we focus on the case of modules
without a global compass and show that four (resp. seven) modules are necessary
and sufficient for restricted (resp. any) initial shapes of an MRS. We also
show that two modules are sufficient when an MRS is touching a wall in an
initial configuration. Then, we clarify the condition to stop an MRS after
evacuation of a rectangular field. Finally, we extend these results to mazes

"Distributed Adaptive and Resilient Control of Multi-Robot Systems with
  Limited Field of View Interactions using Q-Learning","In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamically tuning gains for
multi-robot systems (MRS) under potential based control design framework where
the MRS team coordinates to maintain a connected topology while equipped with
limited field of view sensors. Applying the potential-based control framework
and assuming robot interaction is encoded by a triangular geometry, we derive a
distributed control law in order to achieve the topology control objective. A
typical shortcoming of potential-based control in distributed networks is that
the overall system behavior is highly sensitive to gain-tuning. To overcome
this limitation, we propose a distributed and adaptive gain controller that
preserves a designed pairwise interaction strength, independent of the network
size. Over that, we implement a control scheme that enables the MRS to be
resilient against exogenous attacks on on-board sensors or actuator of the
robots in MRS. In this regard, we model additive sensor and actuator faults
which are induced externally to render the MRS unstable. However, applying
$H_{\infty}$ control protocols by employing a static output-feedback design
technique guarantees bounded $L_2$ gains of the error induced by the sensor and
actuator fault signals. Finally, we apply policy iteration based Q-Learning to
solve for adaptive gains for the discrete-time MRS. Simulation results are

"Multi-institutional Collaborations for Improving Deep Learning-based
  Magnetic Resonance Image Reconstruction Using Federated Learning","Fast and accurate reconstruction of magnetic resonance (MR) images from
under-sampled data is important in many clinical applications. In recent years,
deep learning-based methods have been shown to produce superior performance on
MR image reconstruction. However, these methods require large amounts of data
which is difficult to collect and share due to the high cost of acquisition and
medical data privacy regulations. In order to overcome this challenge, we
propose a federated learning (FL) based solution in which we take advantage of
the MR data available at different institutions while preserving patients'
privacy. However, the generalizability of models trained with the FL setting
can still be suboptimal due to domain shift, which results from the data
collected at multiple institutions with different sensors, disease types, and
acquisition protocols, etc. With the motivation of circumventing this
challenge, we propose a cross-site modeling for MR image reconstruction in
which the learned intermediate latent features among different source sites are
aligned with the distribution of the latent features at the target site.
Extensive experiments are conducted to provide various insights about FL for MR
image reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework is a promising direction to utilize multi-institutional data without
compromising patients' privacy for achieving improved MR image reconstruction.

Dual-Octave Convolution for Accelerated Parallel MR Image Reconstruction,"Magnetic resonance (MR) image acquisition is an inherently prolonged process,
whose acceleration by obtaining multiple undersampled images simultaneously
through parallel imaging has always been the subject of research. In this
paper, we propose the Dual-Octave Convolution (Dual-OctConv), which is capable
of learning multi-scale spatial-frequency features from both real and imaginary
components, for fast parallel MR image reconstruction. By reformulating the
complex operations using octave convolutions, our model shows a strong ability
to capture richer representations of MR images, while at the same time greatly
reducing the spatial redundancy. More specifically, the input feature maps and
convolutional kernels are first split into two components (i.e., real and
imaginary), which are then divided into four groups according to their spatial
frequencies. Then, our Dual-OctConv conducts intra-group information updating
and inter-group information exchange to aggregate the contextual information
across different groups. Our framework provides two appealing benefits: (i) it
encourages interactions between real and imaginary components at various
spatial frequencies to achieve richer representational capacity, and (ii) it
enlarges the receptive field by learning multiple spatial-frequency features of
both the real and imaginary components. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed model on the acceleration of multi-coil MR image reconstruction.
Extensive experiments are conducted on an {in vivo} knee dataset under
different undersampling patterns and acceleration factors. The experimental
results demonstrate the superiority of our model in accelerated parallel MR

Context-aware Telco Outdoor Localization,"Recent years have witnessed the fast growth in telecommunication (Telco)
techniques from 2G to upcoming 5G. Precise outdoor localization is important
for Telco operators to manage, operate and optimize Telco networks. Differing
from GPS, Telco localization is a technique employed by Telco operators to
localize outdoor mobile devices by using measurement report (MR) data. When
given MR samples containing noisy signals (e.g., caused by Telco signal
interference and attenuation), Telco localization often suffers from high
errors. To this end, the main focus of this paper is how to improve Telco
localization accuracy via the algorithms to detect and repair outlier positions
with high errors. Specifically, we propose a context-aware Telco localization
technique, namely RLoc, which consists of three main components: a
machine-learning-based localization algorithm, a detection algorithm to find
flawed samples, and a repair algorithm to replace outlier localization results
by better ones (ideally ground truth positions). Unlike most existing works to
detect and repair every flawed MR sample independently, we instead take into

"Materials and possible mechanisms of extremely large magnetoresistance:
  A review","Magnetoresistance (MR) is a characteristic that the resistance of a substance
changes with the external magnetic field, reflecting various physical origins
and microstructures of the substance. A large MR, namely a huge response to a
low external field, has always been a useful functional feature in industrial
technology and a core goal pursued by physicists and materials scientists.
Conventional large MR materials are mainly manganites, whose colossal MR (CMR)
can be as high as -90%. The dominant mechanism is attributed to spin
configuration aligned by the external field, which reduces magnetic scattering
and thus resistance. In recent years, some new systems have shown an extremely
large unsaturated MR (XMR). Unlike ordinary metals, the positive MR of these
systems can reach 103-108% and is persistent under super high magnetic fields.
The XMR materials are mainly metals or semimetals, distributed in high-mobility
topological or non-topological systems, and some are magnetic, which suggests a
wide range of application scenarios. Various mechanisms have been proposed for
the potential physical origin of XMR, including electron-hole compensation,
steep band, ultrahigh mobility, high residual resistance ratio, topological
fermions, etc. It turns out that some mechanisms play a leading role in certain
systems, while more are far from clearly defined. In addition, the researches
on XMR are largely overlapped or closely correlated with other recently rising
physics and materials researches, such as topological matters and
two-dimensional (2D) materials, which makes elucidating the mechanism of XMR
even more important. Moreover, the disclosed novel properties will lay a broad
and solid foundation for the design and development of functional devices. In
this review, we will discuss several aspects in the following order: ...","['Rui Niu', 'W. K. Zhu']",2021-10-20T09:35:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10454v1
"Maximally recoverable local reconstruction codes from subspace direct
  sum systems","Maximally recoverable local reconstruction codes (MR LRCs for short) have
received great attention in the last few years. Various constructions have been
proposed in literatures. The main focus of this topic is to construct MR LRCs
over small fields. An $(N=nr,r,h,\Gd)$-MR LRC is a linear code over finite
field $\F_\ell$ of length $N$, whose codeword symbols are partitioned into $n$
local groups each of size $r$. Each local group can repair any $\Gd$ erasure
errors and there are further $h$ global parity checks to provide fault
tolerance from more global erasure patterns.
  MR LRCs deployed in practice have a small number of global parities such as
$h=O(1)$. In this parameter setting, all previous constructions require the
field size $\ell =\Omega_h (N^{h-1-o(1)})$. It remains challenging to improve
this bound. In this paper, via subspace direct sum systems, we present a
construction of MR LRC with the field size $\ell= O(N^{h-2+\frac1{h-1}-o(1)})$.
In particular, for the most interesting cases where $h=2,3$, we improve
previous constructions by either reducing field size or removing constraints.
In addition, we also offer some constructions of MR LRCs for larger global
parity $h$ that have field size incomparable with known upper bounds. The main
techniques used in this paper is through subspace direct sum systems that we
introduce. Interestingly, subspace direct sum systems are actually equivalent
to $\F_q$-linear codes over extension fields. Based on various constructions of
subspace direct sum systems, we are able to construct several classes of MR
LRCs.","['Shu Liu', 'Chaoping Xing']",2021-11-05T03:43:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03244v1
"Bayesian Mendelian randomization with study heterogeneity and data
  partitioning for large studies","Background: Mendelian randomization (MR) is a useful approach to causal
inference from observational studies when randomised controlled trials are not
feasible. However, study heterogeneity of two association studies required in
MR is often overlooked. When dealing with large studies, recently developed
Bayesian MR is limited by its computational expensiveness. Methods: We
addressed study heterogeneity by proposing a random effect Bayesian MR model
with multiple exposures and outcomes. For large studies, we adopted a subset
posterior aggregation method to tackle the problem of computation. In
particular, we divided data into subsets and combine estimated subset causal
effects obtained from the subsets"". The performance of our method was evaluated
by a number of simulations, in which part of exposure data was missing.
Results: Random effect Bayesian MR outperformed conventional inverse-variance
weighted estimation, whether the true causal effects are zero or non-zero. Data
partitioning of large studies had little impact on variations of the estimated
causal effects, whereas it notably affected unbiasedness of the estimates with
weak instruments and high missing rate of data. Our simulation results indicate
that data partitioning is a good way of improving computational efficiency, for
little cost of decrease in unbiasedness of the estimates, as long as the sample
size of subsets is reasonably large. Conclusions: We have further advanced
Bayesian MR by including random effects to explicitly account for study
heterogeneity. We also adopted a subset posterior aggregation method to address
the issue of computational expensiveness of MCMC, which is important especially
when dealing with large studies. Our proposed work is likely to pave the way
for more general model settings, as Bayesian approach itself renders great
flexibility in model constructions.","['Linyi Zou', 'Hui Guo', 'Carlo Berzuini']",2021-12-15T14:17:25Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08147v1
"PARCEL: Physics-based Unsupervised Contrastive Representation Learning
  for Multi-coil MR Imaging","With the successful application of deep learning to magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, parallel imaging techniques based on neural networks have attracted
wide attention. However, in the absence of high-quality, fully sampled datasets
for training, the performance of these methods is limited. And the
interpretability of models is not strong enough. To tackle this issue, this
paper proposes a Physics-bAsed unsupeRvised Contrastive rEpresentation Learning
(PARCEL) method to speed up parallel MR imaging. Specifically, PARCEL has a
parallel framework to contrastively learn two branches of model-based unrolling
networks from augmented undersampled multi-coil k-space data. A sophisticated
co-training loss with three essential components has been designed to guide the
two networks in capturing the inherent features and representations for MR
images. And the final MR image is reconstructed with the trained contrastive
networks. PARCEL was evaluated on two vivo datasets and compared to five
state-of-the-art methods. The results show that PARCEL is able to learn
essential representations for accurate MR reconstruction without relying on
fully sampled datasets.","['Shanshan Wang', 'Ruoyou Wu', 'Cheng Li', 'Juan Zou', 'Ziyao Zhang', 'Qiegen Liu', 'Yan Xi', 'Hairong Zheng']",2022-02-03T10:09:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01494v3
"Using Source Code Metrics for Predicting Metamorphic Relations at Method
  Level","Metamorphic testing (TM) examines the relations between inputs and outputs of
test runs. These relations are known as metamorphic relations (MR). Currently,
MRs are handpicked and require in-depth knowledge of the System Under Test
(SUT), as well as its problem domain. As a result, the identification and
selection of high-quality MRs is a challenge. \citeauthor{PMR1} suggested the
Predicting Metamorphic Relations (PMR) approach for automatic prediction of
applicable MRs picked from a predefined list. PMR is based on a Support Vector
Machine (SVM) model using features derived from the Control Flow Graphs (CFGs)
of 100 Java methods. The original study of \citeauthor{PMR1} showed encouraging
results, but developing classification models from CFG-related features is
costly. In this paper, we aim at developing a PMR approach that is less costly
without losing performance. We complement the original PMR approach by
considering other than CFG-related features. We define 21 features that can be
directly extracted from source code and build several classifiers, including
SVM models. Our results indicate that using the original CFG-based method-level
features, in particular for a SVM with random walk kernel (RWK), achieve better
predictions in terms of AUC-ROC for most of the candidate MRs than our models.
However, for one of the candidate MRs, using source code features achieved the
best AUC-ROC result (greater than 0.8).","['Alejandra Duque-Torres', 'Dietmar Pfahl', 'Claus Klammer', 'Stefan Fischer']",2022-05-31T14:39:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15835v1
"Intelligent Reflective Surface vs. Mobile Relay-supported NLoS Avoidance
  in Indoor mmWave Networks","The 6th generation of wireless communication (6G) is envisioned to give rise
to various technologies for improving the end-to-end communication performance,
where the communication is envisioned to utilize wireless signals in the
millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies and above. Among others, these
technologies comprise Intelligent Reflective Surfaces (IRSs) and Mobile Relays
(MRs), whose envisaged roles include mitigating the negative effects of
Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) connectivity, in particular at mmWave and higher
frequencies. The core idea behind these technologies is to use cooperative
networking where the source sends a signal to a repeater, in this case the IRS
or the MR, which is upon reception forwarded to the destination. When comparing
the two technologies, it is important to realize that the IRSs are primarily
envisioned to be static entities attached to various objects in the environment
such as walls and furniture. In contrast, the MRs will feature a higher degree
of freedom, as they will be able to position themselves seamlessly in the
environment. Based on the above assumptions, we derive an approach for
determining the optimal position of the IRS and MR in indoor environments,
i.e., the one that maximizes the end-to-end link quality between the source and
the destination. We follow by capturing the communication quality indicators
for both IRS- and MR-supported NLoS avoidance in indoor mmWave communication in
a number of scenarios. Our results show that, from the end-to-end link quality
perspective, the MRs generally outperform the IRSs, suggesting their
utilization potential for throughput-optimized NLoS avoidance scenarios.","['Maria Bustamante Madrid', 'Jeroen Famaey', 'Filip Lemic']",2022-07-14T16:46:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07050v1
"Where is the mind within the brain? Transient selection of subnetworks
  by metabotropic receptors and G protein-gated ion channels","Perhaps the most important question posed by brain research is: How the brain
gives rise to the mind. To answer this question, we have primarily relied on
the connectionist paradigm: The brain's entire knowledge and thinking skills
are thought to be stored in the connections; and the mental operations are
executed by network computations. I propose here an alternative paradigm: Our
knowledge and skills are stored in metabotropic receptors (MRs) and the G
protein-gated ion channels (GPGICs). Here, mental operations are assumed to be
executed by the functions of MRs and GPGICs. As GPGICs have the capacity to
close or open branches of dendritic trees and axon terminals, their states
transiently re-route neural activity throughout the nervous system. First, MRs
detect ligands that signal the need to activate GPGICs. Next, GPGICs
transiently selects a subnetwork within the brain. The process of selecting
this new subnetwork is what constitutes a mental operation -- be it in a form
of directed attention, perception of a grandmother or making a decision.
Synaptic connections and network computations play only a secondary role,
supporting MRs and GPGICs. According to this new paradigm, the mind emerges
within the brain as the function of MRs and GPGICs whose primary function is to
continually select the pathways over which neural activity will be allowed to
pass. It is argued that MRs and GPGICs solve the scaling problem of
intelligence from which the connectionism paradigm suffers.",['Danko Nikolić'],2022-07-11T11:32:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11249v3
Almost exact Mendelian randomization,"Mendelian randomization (MR) is a natural experimental design based on the
random transmission of genes from parents to offspring. However, this
inferential basis is typically only implicit or used as an informal
justification. As parent-offspring data becomes more widely available, we
advocate a different approach to MR that is exactly based on this natural
randomization, thereby formalizing the analogy between MR and randomized
controlled trials. We begin by developing a causal graphical model for MR which
represents several biological processes and phenomena, including population
structure, gamete formation, fertilization, genetic linkage, and pleiotropy.
This causal graph is then used to detect biases in population-based MR studies
and identify sufficient confounder adjustment sets to correct these biases. We
then propose a randomization test in the within-family MR design using the
exogenous randomness in meiosis and fertilization, which is extensively studied
in genetics. Besides its transparency and conceptual appeals, our approach also
offers some practical advantages, including robustness to misspecified
phenotype models, robustness to weak instruments, and elimination of bias
arising from population structure, assortative mating, dynastic effects, and
horizontal pleiotropy. We conclude with an analysis of a pair of negative and
positive controls in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. The

in many clinical applications. Deep learning (DL) has recently achieved
state-of-the-art or even human-level performance on various image segmentation
tasks. Nevertheless, manually annotating volumetric MR images for DL model
training is labor-exhaustive and time-consuming. In this work, we aim to train
a semi-supervised and self-supervised collaborative learning framework for
prostate 3D MR image segmentation while using extremely sparse annotations, for
which the ground truth annotations are provided for just the central slice of
each volumetric MR image. Specifically, semi-supervised learning and
self-supervised learning methods are used to generate two independent sets of
pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are then fused by Boolean operation to
extract a more confident pseudo label set. The images with either manual or
network self-generated labels are then employed to train a segmentation model
for target volume extraction. Experimental results on a publicly available
prostate MR image dataset demonstrate that, while requiring significantly less
annotation effort, our framework generates very encouraging segmentation
results. The proposed framework is very useful in clinical applications when
training data with dense annotations are difficult to obtain.","['Yousuf Babiker M. Osman', 'Cheng Li', 'Weijian Huang', 'Nazik Elsayed', 'Zhenzhen Xue', 'Hairong Zheng', 'Shanshan Wang']",2022-11-16T11:40:13Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08840v1
"Multimodal Deep Learning to Differentiate Tumor Recurrence from
  Treatment Effect in Human Glioblastoma","Differentiating tumor progression (TP) from treatment-related necrosis (TN)
is critical for clinical management decisions in glioblastoma (GBM). Dynamic
FDG PET (dPET), an advance from traditional static FDG PET, may prove
advantageous in clinical staging. dPET includes novel methods of a
model-corrected blood input function that accounts for partial volume averaging
to compute parametric maps that reveal kinetic information. In a preliminary
study, a convolution neural network (CNN) was trained to predict classification
accuracy between TP and TN for $35$ brain tumors from $26$ subjects in the
PET-MR image space. 3D parametric PET Ki (from dPET), traditional static PET
standardized uptake values (SUV), and also the brain tumor MR voxels formed the
input for the CNN. The average test accuracy across all leave-one-out
cross-validation iterations adjusting for class weights was $0.56$ using only
the MR, $0.65$ using only the SUV, and $0.71$ using only the Ki voxels.
Combining SUV and MR voxels increased the test accuracy to $0.62$. On the other
hand, MR and Ki voxels increased the test accuracy to $0.74$. Thus, dPET
features alone or with MR features in deep learning models would enhance
prediction accuracy in differentiating TP vs TN in GBM.","['Tonmoy Hossain', 'Zoraiz Qureshi', 'Nivetha Jayakumar', 'Thomas Eluvathingal Muttikkal', 'Sohil Patel', 'David Schiff', 'Miaomiao Zhang', 'Bijoy Kundu']",2023-02-27T20:12:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14124v1
"Arbitrary Reduction of MRI Inter-slice Spacing Using Hierarchical
  Feature Conditional Diffusion","Magnetic resonance (MR) images collected in 2D scanning protocols typically
have large inter-slice spacing, resulting in high in-plane resolution but
reduced through-plane resolution. Super-resolution techniques can reduce the
inter-slice spacing of 2D scanned MR images, facilitating the downstream visual
experience and computer-aided diagnosis. However, most existing
super-resolution methods are trained at a fixed scaling ratio, which is
inconvenient in clinical settings where MR scanning may have varying
inter-slice spacings. To solve this issue, we propose Hierarchical Feature
Conditional Diffusion (HiFi-Diff)} for arbitrary reduction of MR inter-slice
spacing. Given two adjacent MR slices and the relative positional offset,
HiFi-Diff can iteratively convert a Gaussian noise map into any desired
in-between MR slice. Furthermore, to enable fine-grained conditioning, the
Hierarchical Feature Extraction (HiFE) module is proposed to hierarchically
extract conditional features and conduct element-wise modulation. Our
experimental results on the publicly available HCP-1200 dataset demonstrate the
high-fidelity super-resolution capability of HiFi-Diff and its efficacy in
enhancing downstream segmentation performance.","['Xin Wang', 'Zhenrong Shen', 'Zhiyun Song', 'Sheng Wang', 'Mengjun Liu', 'Lichi Zhang', 'Kai Xuan', 'Qian Wang']",2023-04-16T12:05:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07756v3

Specifically, we examine and summarize studies published between 2017 and 2023

ML in MRS is still in its early stages, with a primary focus on processing and

is a crucial topic, with no consistent method for its generation. Furthermore,
many studies demonstrate that artificial data suffers from generalization
issues when tested on in-vivo data. We also conclude that risks related to ML

"Generalizable Learning Reconstruction for Accelerating MR Imaging via
  Federated Neural Architecture Search","Heterogeneous data captured by different scanning devices and imaging
protocols can affect the generalization performance of the deep learning
magnetic resonance (MR) reconstruction model. While a centralized training
model is effective in mitigating this problem, it raises concerns about privacy
protection. Federated learning is a distributed training paradigm that can
utilize multi-institutional data for collaborative training without sharing
data. However, existing federated learning MR image reconstruction methods rely
on models designed manually by experts, which are complex and computational
expensive, suffering from performance degradation when facing heterogeneous
data distributions. In addition, these methods give inadequate consideration to
fairness issues, namely, ensuring that the model's training does not introduce
bias towards any specific dataset's distribution. To this end, this paper
proposes a generalizable federated neural architecture search framework for
accelerating MR imaging (GAutoMRI). Specifically, automatic neural architecture
search is investigated for effective and efficient neural network
representation learning of MR images from different centers. Furthermore, we
design a fairness adjustment approach that can enable the model to learn
features fairly from inconsistent distributions of different devices and
centers, and thus enforce the model generalize to the unseen center. Extensive
experiments show that our proposed GAutoMRI has better performances and
generalization ability compared with six state-of-the-art federated learning
methods. Moreover, the GAutoMRI model is significantly more lightweight, making
it an efficient choice for MR image reconstruction tasks. The code will be made

Migrant Resettlement by Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization,"Migration has been a universal phenomenon, which brings opportunities as well
as challenges for global development. As the number of migrants (e.g.,
refugees) increases rapidly in recent years, a key challenge faced by each
country is the problem of migrant resettlement. This problem has attracted
scientific research attention, from the perspective of maximizing the
employment rate. Previous works mainly formulated migrant resettlement as an
approximately submodular optimization problem subject to multiple matroid
constraints and employed the greedy algorithm, whose performance, however, may
be limited due to its greedy nature. In this paper, we propose a new framework
MR-EMO based on Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization, which reformulates
Migrant Resettlement as a bi-objective optimization problem that maximizes the
expected number of employed migrants and minimizes the number of dispatched
migrants simultaneously, and employs a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm
(MOEA) to solve the bi-objective problem. We implement MR-EMO using three
MOEAs, the popular NSGA-II, MOEA/D as well as the theoretically grounded GSEMO.
To further improve the performance of MR-EMO, we propose a specific MOEA,
called GSEMO-SR, using matrix-swap mutation and repair mechanism, which has a
better ability to search for feasible solutions. We prove that MR-EMO using
either GSEMO or GSEMO-SR can achieve better theoretical guarantees than the
previous greedy algorithm. Experimental results under the interview and
coordination migration models clearly show the superiority of MR-EMO (with
either NSGA-II, MOEA/D, GSEMO or GSEMO-SR) over previous algorithms, and that
using GSEMO-SR leads to the best performance of MR-EMO.","['Dan-Xuan Liu', 'Yu-Ran Gu', 'Chao Qian', 'Xin Mu', 'Ke Tang']",2023-10-13T06:58:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08896v2
Marginal Density Ratio for Off-Policy Evaluation in Contextual Bandits,"Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) in contextual bandits is crucial for assessing
new policies using existing data without costly experimentation. However,
current OPE methods, such as Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and Doubly
Robust (DR) estimators, suffer from high variance, particularly in cases of low
overlap between target and behavior policies or large action and context
spaces. In this paper, we introduce a new OPE estimator for contextual bandits,
the Marginal Ratio (MR) estimator, which focuses on the shift in the marginal
distribution of outcomes $Y$ instead of the policies themselves. Through
rigorous theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the benefits of the MR estimator
compared to conventional methods like IPW and DR in terms of variance
reduction. Additionally, we establish a connection between the MR estimator and
the state-of-the-art Marginalized Inverse Propensity Score (MIPS) estimator,
proving that MR achieves lower variance among a generalized family of MIPS
estimators. We further illustrate the utility of the MR estimator in causal
inference settings, where it exhibits enhanced performance in estimating
Average Treatment Effects (ATE). Our experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets corroborate our theoretical findings and highlight the practical
advantages of the MR estimator in OPE for contextual bandits.","['Muhammad Faaiz Taufiq', 'Arnaud Doucet', 'Rob Cornish', 'Jean-Francois Ton']",2023-12-03T17:04:57Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01457v1
"Effects of a mixed reality headset on the delay of visually evoked
  potentials","Virtual and mixed reality (VR, MR) technologies offer a powerful solution for
on-the-ground flight training curricula. While these technologies offer safer
and cheaper instructional programs, it is still unclear how they impact
neuronal brain dynamics. Indeed, MR simulations engage students in a strange
mix of incongruous visual, somatosensory and vestibular sensory input.
Characterizing brain dynamics during MR simulation is important for
understanding cognitive processes during virtual flight training. To this end,
we studies the delays introduced in the neuronal stream from the retina to the
visual cortex when presented with visual stimuli using a Varjo-XR3 headset. We
recorded cortical visual evoked potentials (VEPs) from 6 subjects under two
conditions. First, we recorded normal VEPs triggered by short flashes. Second,
we recorded VEPs triggered by an internal image of the flashes produced by the
Varjo-XR3 headset. All subjects had used the headset before and were familiar
with immersive experiences. Our results show mixed-reality stimulation imposes
a small, but consistent, 4 [ms] processing delay in the N2-VEP component during
MR stimulation as compared to direct stimulation. Also we found that VEP
amplitudes during MR stimulation were also decreased. These results suggest
that visual cognition during mixed-reality training is delayed, not only by the
unavoidalbe hardware/software processing delays of the headset and the attached
computer, but also by an extra biological delay induced by the headset's
limited visual display in terms of the image intensity and contrast. As flight
training is a demanding task, this study measures visual signal latency to
better understand how MR affects the sensation of immersion.","['Víctor Manuel Hidalgo', 'Carlos Andrés Bazaes', 'Juan-Carlos Letelier']",2023-12-04T19:39:32Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02305v1

central line placement training with MR does not increase significantly

"Disentangled Multimodal Brain MR Image Translation via Transformer-based
  Modality Infuser","Multimodal Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging plays a crucial role in disease
diagnosis due to its ability to provide complementary information by analyzing
a relationship between multimodal images on the same subject. Acquiring all MR
modalities, however, can be expensive, and, during a scanning session, certain
MR images may be missed depending on the study protocol. The typical solution
would be to synthesize the missing modalities from the acquired images such as
using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Yet, GANs constructed with
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are likely to suffer from a lack of global
relationships and mechanisms to condition the desired modality. To address
this, in this work, we propose a transformer-based modality infuser designed to
synthesize multimodal brain MR images. In our method, we extract
modality-agnostic features from the encoder and then transform them into
modality-specific features using the modality infuser. Furthermore, the
modality infuser captures long-range relationships among all brain structures,
leading to the generation of more realistic images. We carried out experiments

"IGUANe: a 3D generalizable CycleGAN for multicenter harmonization of
  brain MR images","In MRI studies, the aggregation of imaging data from multiple acquisition
sites enhances sample size but may introduce site-related variabilities that
hinder consistency in subsequent analyses. Deep learning methods for image
translation have emerged as a solution for harmonizing MR images across sites.
In this study, we introduce IGUANe (Image Generation with Unified Adversarial
Networks), an original 3D model that leverages the strengths of domain
translation and straightforward application of style transfer methods for
multicenter brain MR image harmonization. IGUANe extends CycleGAN architecture
by integrating an arbitrary number of domains for training through a
many-to-one strategy. During inference, the model can be applied to any image,
even from an unknown acquisition site, making it a universal generator for
harmonization. Trained on a dataset comprising T1-weighted images from 11
different scanners, IGUANe was evaluated on data from unseen sites. The
assessments included the transformation of MR images with traveling subjects,
the preservation of pairwise distances between MR images within domains, the
evolution of volumetric patterns related to age and Alzheimer$^\prime$s disease
(AD), and the performance in age regression and patient classification tasks.
Comparisons with other harmonization and normalization methods suggest that
IGUANe better preserves individual information in MR images and is more
suitable for maintaining and reinforcing variabilities related to age and AD.
Future studies may further assess IGUANe in other multicenter contexts, either
using the same model or retraining it for applications to different image
modalities.","['Vincent Roca', 'Grégory Kuchcinski', 'Jean-Pierre Pruvo', 'Dorian Manouvriez', 'Renaud Lopes']",2024-02-05T17:38:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03227v3

that strong LLMs like GPT-4-turbo excel in evaluating the reliability of
responses from LLMs, but face efficiency and local deployment issues. Thus, to
enable weak LLMs to effectively assess the reliability of LLM responses, we
propose a novel cross-query-comparison-based method called $\textit{Meta
Ranking}$ (MR). Unlike previous few-shot methods that solely based on
in-context learning capabilities in LLMs, MR assesses reliability by pairwisely
ranking the target query-response pair with multiple reference query-response
pairs. We found that MR is highly effective in error detection for LLM
responses, where weak LLMs, such as Phi-2, could surpass strong baselines like
GPT-3.5-turbo, requiring only five reference samples and significantly
improving efficiency. We further demonstrate that MR can enhance strong LLMs'
performance in two practical applications: model cascading and instruction
tuning. In model cascading, we combine open- and closed-source LLMs to achieve
performance comparable to GPT-4-turbo with lower costs. In instruction tuning,
we use MR for iterative training data filtering, significantly reducing data
processing time and enabling LLaMA-7B and Phi-2 to surpass Alpaca-13B with
fewer training tokens. These results underscore the high potential of MR in
both efficiency and effectiveness.","['Zijun Liu', 'Boqun Kou', 'Peng Li', 'Ming Yan', 'Ji Zhang', 'Fei Huang', 'Yang Liu']",2024-02-19T13:57:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12146v3

"Resistive and magnetoresistive properties of CrO2 pressed powders with
  different types of inter-granular dielectric layers","Resistive, magnetoresistive and magnetic properties of four kinds of pressed
CrO2 powders, synthesized by hydrothermal method of chromic anhydride have been
investigated. The particles in powders constituted of rounded particles
(diameter 120 nm) or needle-shaped crystals with an average diameter of 22.9 nm
and average length of 302 nm. All of the particles had a surface dielectric
shell of varying thickness and different types (such as oxyhydroxide -CrOOH or
chromium oxide Cr2O3). For all the samples at low temperatures we found
non-metallic temperature dependence of resistivity and giant negative
magnetoresistance (MR). The maximum value of MR at low temperatures (T \approx
5 K) is \approx 37% in relatively small fields (0.5 T). At higher temperatures
there was a rapid decrease of MR (up to \approx 1% / T at T \approx 200 K). The
main objective of this work was studying the influence of properties and
thickness of the intergranular dielectric layers, as well as CrO2 particle
shape, on the magnitude of the tunneling resistance and MR of the pressed
powder. The new results obtained in this study include: (1) detection at low
temperatures in powders with needle-like particles a new type of MR hysteresis,
and nonmonotonic MR behaviour with increasing magnetic field (absolute value of
the MR at first grows rather rapidly with the field, and then begins
diminishing markedly, forming a maximum), and (2) detection of non-monotonic
temperature dependence, where - a field in which the resistance in a magnetic
field has a maximum, as well as finding discrepancies in values of and
coercivity fields, (3) detection of the anisotropy of MR, depending on the
relative orientation of the transport current and the magnetic field, (4) a new
method of synthesis, to regulate the thickness of dielectric coating.","['N. V. Dalakova', 'B. I. Belevtsev', 'E. Yu. Beliayev', 'O. M. Bludov', 'V. A. Pashchenko', 'M. G. Osmolovsky', 'O. M. Osmolovskaya']",2012-06-07T15:51:00Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1533v1
"On Regularizing Effects of MINRES and MR-II for Large-Scale Symmetric
  Discrete Ill-Posed Problems","For large scale symmetric discrete ill-posed problems, MINRES and MR-II are
often used iterative regularization solvers. We call a regularized solution
best possible if it is at least as accurate as the best regularized solution
obtained by the truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) method. In this
paper, we analyze their regularizing effects and establish the following
results: (i) the filtered SVD expression are derived for the regularized
solutions by MINRES; (ii) a hybrid MINRES that uses explicit regularization
within projected problems is needed to compute a best possible regularized
solution to a given ill-posed problem; (iii) the $k$th iterate by MINRES is
more accurate than the $(k-1)$th iterate by MR-II until the semi-convergence of
MINRES, but MR-II has globally better regularizing effects than MINRES; (iv)
bounds are obtained for the 2-norm distance between an underlying
$k$-dimensional Krylov subspace and the $k$-dimensional dominant eigenspace.
They show that MR-II has better regularizing effects for severely and
moderately ill-posed problems than for mildly ill-posed problems, and a hybrid
MR-II is needed to get a best possible regularized solution for mildly
ill-posed problems; (v) bounds are derived for the entries generated by the
symmetric Lanczos process that MR-II is based on, showing how fast they decay.
Numerical experiments confirm our assertions. Stronger than our theory, the
regularizing effects of MR-II are experimentally shown to be good enough to
obtain best possible regularized solutions for severely and moderately
ill-posed problems.","['Yi Huang', 'Zhongxiao Jia']",2015-03-13T02:29:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03936v3
CPP Magnetoresistance of Magnetic Multilayers: A critical review,"We present a comprehensive review of data and analysis of Giant (G)
Magnetoresistance (MR) with Current-flow Perpendicular-to-layer-Planes (CPP-MR)
of magnetic multilayers [F/N]n (n = number of repeats) with alternating
nanoscale layers of ferromagnetic (F) and non-magnetic (N) metals. GMR, a large
change in resistance when an applied magnetic field changes the moment ordering
of adjacent F-layers from anti-parallel (AP) to parallel (P), was discovered in
1988 in the Current-flow-in-layer-Planes (CIP) geometry. The CPP-MR has two
advantages over the CIP-MR: (1) it allows more direct access to the underlying
physics; and (2) it is usually larger, which should be advantageous for
devices. When the first CPP-MR data were published in 1991, it was not clear
whether electronic transport in GMR multilayers is fully diffusive or at least
partly ballistic. It was not known whether the properties of layers and
interfaces would vary with layer thickness or number. It was not known if the
CPP-MR would be dominated by scattering within the F-metals or at the F/N
interfaces. Nothing was known about: (1) spin-flipping within F-metals,
characterized by a spin-diffusion length, l(F)sf; (2) interface specific
resistances (AR = area A times resistance R) for N1/N2 interfaces; (3)
interface specific resistances and spin-dependent scattering asymmetry at F/N
and F1/F2 interfaces; and (4) spin-flipping at F/N, F1/F2 and N1/N2 interfaces.
Knowledge of spin-dependent scattering asymmetries in F-metals and F-alloys,
and of spin-flipping in N-metals and N-alloys was limited. We show how CPP-MR
measurements have quantified the scattering and spin-flipping parameters that
determine CPP-MR for a wide range of F- and N-metals and alloys and of F/N
pairs. We also review progress in finding techniques and F-alloys and F/N pairs
to enhance the CPP-MR to make it more competitive for devices.",['Jack Bass'],2015-11-23T19:54:27Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07387v1

"Generation of abdominal synthetic CTs from 0.35T MR images using
  generative adversarial networks for MR-only liver radiotherapy","Electron density maps must be accurately estimated to achieve valid dose
calculation in MR-only radiotherapy. The goal of this study is to assess
whether two deep learning models, the conditional generative adversarial
network (cGAN) and the cycle-consistent generative adversarial network
(cycleGAN), can generate accurate abdominal synthetic CT (sCT) images from
0.35T MR images for MR-only liver radiotherapy. A retrospective study was
performed using CT images and 0.35T MR images of 12 patients with liver (n=8)
and non-liver abdominal (n=4) cancer. CT images were deformably registered to
the corresponding MR images to generate deformed CT (dCT) images for treatment
planning. Both cGAN and cycleGAN were trained using MR and dCT transverse
slices. Four-fold cross-validation testing was conducted to generate sCT images
for all patients. The HU prediction accuracy was evaluated by voxel-wise
similarity metric between each dCT and sCT image for all 12 patients. dCT-based
and sCT-based dose distributions were compared using gamma and dose-volume
histogram (DVH) metric analysis for 8 liver patients. sCTcycleGAN achieved the
average mean absolute error (MAE) of 94.1 HU, while sCTcGAN achieved 89.8 HU.
In both models, the average gamma passing rates within all volumes of interest
were higher than 95% using a 2%, 2 mm criterion, and 99% using a 3%, 3 mm
criterion. The average differences in the mean dose and DVH metrics were within
+/-0.6% for the planning target volume and within +/-0.15% for evaluated organs
in both models. Results demonstrated that abdominal sCT images generated by
both cGAN and cycleGAN achieved accurate dose calculation for 8 liver
radiotherapy plans. sCTcGAN images had smaller average MAE and achieved better
dose calculation accuracy than sCTcyleGAN images. More abdominal patients will
be enrolled in the future to further evaluate two models.","['Jie Fu', 'Kamal Singhrao', 'Minsong Cao', 'Victoria Yu', 'Anand P. Santhanam', 'Yingli Yang', 'Minghao Guo', 'Ann C. Raldow', 'Dan Ruan', 'John H. Lewis']",2019-08-13T18:14:51Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04809v1

Deep Low-rank Prior in Dynamic MR Imaging,"The deep learning methods have achieved attractive performance in dynamic MR
cine imaging. However, all of these methods are only driven by the sparse prior
of MR images, while the important low-rank (LR) prior of dynamic MR cine images
is not explored, which limits the further improvements on dynamic MR
reconstruction. In this paper, a learned singular value thresholding
(Learned-SVT) operation is proposed to explore deep low-rank prior in dynamic
MR imaging for obtaining improved reconstruction results. In particular, we
come up with two novel and distinct schemes to introduce the learnable low-rank
prior into deep network architectures in an unrolling manner and a
plug-and-play manner respectively. In the unrolling manner, we put forward a
model-based unrolling sparse and low-rank network for dynamic MR imaging,
dubbed SLR-Net. The SLR-Net is defined over a deep network flow graph, which is
unrolled from the iterative procedures in the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding
Algorithm (ISTA) for optimizing a sparse and low-rank based dynamic MRI model.
In the plug-and-play manner, we present a plug-and-play LR network module that
can be easily embedded into any other dynamic MR neural networks without
changing the network paradigm. Experimental results show that both schemes can
further improve the state-of-the-art CS methods, such as k-t SLR, and
sparsity-driven deep learning-based methods, such as DC-CNN and CRNN, both
qualitatively and quantitatively.","['Ziwen Ke', 'Wenqi Huang', 'Jing Cheng', 'Zhuoxu Cui', 'Sen Jia', 'Haifeng Wang', 'Xin Liu', 'Hairong Zheng', 'Leslie Ying', 'Yanjie Zhu', 'Dong Liang']",2020-06-22T09:26:10Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12090v4
"Non-rigid 3D motion estimation at high temporal resolution from
  prospectively undersampled k-space data using low-rank MR-MOTUS","With the recent introduction of the MR-LINAC, an MR-scanner combined with a
radiotherapy LINAC, MR-based motion estimation has become of increasing
interest to (retrospectively) characterize tumor and organs-at-risk motion
during radiotherapy. To this extent, we introduce low-rank MR-MOTUS, a
framework to retrospectively reconstruct time-resolved non-rigid 3D+t
motion-fields from a single low-resolution reference image and prospectively
undersampled k-space data acquired during motion. Low-rank MR-MOTUS exploits
spatio-temporal correlations in internal body motion with a low-rank motion
model, and inverts a signal model that relates motion-fields directly to a
reference image and k-space data. The low-rank model reduces the
degrees-of-freedom, memory consumption and reconstruction times by assuming a
factorization of space-time motion-fields in spatial and temporal components.
Low-rank MR-MOTUS was employed to estimate motion in 2D/3D abdominothoracic
scans and 3D head scans. Data were acquired using golden-ratio radial readouts.
Reconstructed 2D and 3D respiratory motion-fields were respectively validated
against time-resolved and respiratory-resolved image reconstructions, and the
head motion against static image reconstructions from fully-sampled data
acquired right before and right after the motion. Results show that 2D+t
respiratory motion can be estimated retrospectively at 40.8
motion-fields-per-second, 3D+t respiratory motion at 7.6
motion-fields-per-second and 3D+t head-neck motion at 9.3
motion-fields-per-second. The validations show good consistency with image
reconstructions. The proposed framework can estimate time-resolved non-rigid 3D
motion-fields, which allows to characterize drifts and intra and inter-cycle
patterns in breathing motion during radiotherapy, and could form the basis for
real-time MR-guided radiotherapy.","['Niek R. F. Huttinga', 'Tom Bruijnen', 'Cornelis A. T. van den Berg', 'Alessandro Sbrizzi']",2020-07-01T13:44:52Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00488v1
"Bridging hybrid- and full-kinetic models with Landau-fluid electrons: I.
  2D magnetic reconnection","Magnetic reconnection (MR) plays a fundamental role in plasma dynamics under
many different conditions, from space and astrophysical environments to
laboratory devices. High-resolution in-situ measurements from space missions
allow to study naturally occurring MR processes in great detail. Alongside
direct measurements, numerical simulations play a key role in investigating the
fundamental physics underlying MR. The choice of an adequate plasma model to be
employed in numerical simulations, while also compromising with their
computational cost, is crucial to efficiently address the problem. We consider
a new plasma model that includes a refined electron response within the
hybrid-kinetic framework (kinetic ions, fluid electrons). The extent to which
this new model can reproduce a full-kinetic description of 2D MR, with
particular focus on its robustness during the non-linear stage, is evaluated.
We perform 2D simulations of MR with moderate guide field by means of three
different plasma models: a hybrid-Vlasov-Maxwell model with isotropic,
isothermal electrons, a hybrid-Vlasov-Landau-fluid (HVLF) model where an
anisotropic electron fluid is equipped with a Landau-fluid closure, and a
full-kinetic one. When compared to the full-kinetic case, the HVLF model
effectively reproduces the main features of MR, as well as several aspects of
the associated electron micro-physics and its feedback onto proton dynamics.
This includes the global evolution of MR and the local physics occurring within
the so-called electron-diffusion region, as well as the evolution of species
pressure anisotropy. In particular, anisotropy driven instabilities (such as
firehose, mirror, and cyclotron instabilities) play a relevant role in
regulating electrons anisotropy during the non-linear stage of MR. As expected,
the HVLF model captures all these features, except for the electron-cyclotron
instability.","['Francesco Finelli', 'Silvio S. Cerri', 'Francesco Califano', 'Francesco Pucci', 'Dimitri Laveder', 'Giovanni Lapenta', 'Thierry Passot']",2020-12-31T19:10:36Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00040v2

both the Hall effect and the magnetoresistance (MR) of the films as a function
of the angle between the applied field and the normal to the films at
temperatures above Tc. We extracted the extraordinary Hall effect that is
proportional to the perpendicular component of the magnetization and thus the
MR for each angle of the applied field could be correlated with the magnitude
and orientation of the induced magnetization. We successfully fit the MR data
with a second order magnetization expansion, which indicates large anisotropic
MR in the paramagnetic state. The extremum values of resistivity are not

the temperature range of 5K-320K. At 5K, an unusually large MR of almost 98% is
observed in the x=0.15 sample, nearly up to fields of 4-5 Tesla. This large
high-field MR occurs in the metallic region, far below the insulator-metal
transition temperature, and does not vary linearly with applied field. The
unusual magnetoresistance is explained the light of various possibilities of
phase segregation and cluster spin-glass behavior. Keywords: Manganites, High

"Large magnetoresistance at room-temperature in small molecular weight
  organic semiconductor sandwich devices","We present an extensive study of a large, room temperature negative
magnetoresistance (MR) effect in tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum sandwich
devices in weak magnetic fields. The effect is similar to that previously
discovered in polymer devices. We characterize this effect and discuss its
dependence on field direction, voltage, temperature, film thickness, and
electrode materials. The MR effect reaches almost 10% at fields of
approximately 10 mT at room temperature. The effect shows only a weak
temperature dependence and is independent of the sign and direction of the
magnetic field. Measuring the devices' current-voltage characteristics, we find
that the current depends on the voltage through a power-law. We find that the
magnetic field changes the prefactor of the power-law, whereas the exponent
remains unaffected. We also studied the effect of the magnetic field on the
electroluminescence (MEL) of the devices and analyze the relationship between
MR and MEL. We find that the largest part of MEL is simply a consequence of a
change in device current caused by the MR effect.","['Ö. Mermer', 'G. Veeraraghavan', 'T. L. Francis', 'M. Wohlgenannt']",2005-01-07T00:13:43Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0501124v1
"The role of ferroelectric-ferromagnetic layers on the properties of
  superlattice-based multiferroics","A series of superlattices and trilayers composed of ferromagnetic and
ferroelectric or paraelectric layers were grown on (100) SrTiO3 by the pulsed
laser deposition technique. Their structural and magneto-electric properties
were examined. The superlattices made of ferromagnetic Pr0.85Ca0.15MnO3 (PCMO)
and a ferroelectric, namely Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3 (BST) or BaTiO3, showed enhanced
magnetoresistance (MR) at high applied magnetic field, whereas such enhancement
was absent in Pr0.85Ca0.15MnO3/SrTiO3 superlattices, which clearly demonstrates
the preponderant role of the ferroelectric layers in this enhanced MR.
Furthermore, the absence of enhanced MR in trilayers of PCMO/BST indicates that
the magneto-electric coupling which is responsible for MR in these systems is
stronger in multilayers than in their trilayer counterparts.","['P. Murugavel', 'M. P. Singh', 'W. Prellier', 'B. Mercey', 'Ch. Simon', 'B. Raveau']",2005-03-25T00:23:45Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0503609v1

$Nd_{2-x}Ce_xCuO_{4}$. \emph{A giant anisotropy} in MR is observed at low

magnitude just by changing B direction within $CuO_2$ plane and a scaling
behavior between out-of-plane and in-plane MR is found. A ""Spin valve"" effect
is proposed to understand the giant anisotropy of out-of-plane MR and the
evolution of scaling parameters with the external field. It is found that the

is the key to understand the giant anisotropy. These results suggest that a

heterojunction solar cells (BHSCs) to clarify the role of formation of
coulombically bound electron-hole (e-h) pairs on the magnetoresistance (MR)
response in organic thin film devices. BHSCs are suitable model systems because
they effectively quench excitons but the probability of forming e-h pairs in
them can be tuned over orders of magnitude by the choice of material and
solvent in the blend. We have systematically varied the e-h recombination
coefficients, which are directly proportional to the probability for the charge
carriers to meet in space, and found that a reduced probability of electrons
and holes meeting in space lead to disappearance of the MR. Our results clearly
show that MR is a direct consequence of e-h pair formation. We also found that
the MR line shape follows a power law-dependence of B0.5 at higher fields.","['Sayani Majumdar', 'Himadri S Majumdar', 'Harri Aarnio', 'Dirk Vanderzande', 'Reino Laiho', 'Ronald Osterbacka']",2008-05-16T14:24:55Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2546v4

and $\rho$$_c$ / $\rho$$_b$ is given, confirming the quasi-one-dimensionality

magnetoresistance (MR) in polycrystalline La_{0.88}Sr_{0.12}CoO_3. Analogous to
the shift in the magnetic hysteresis loop along the field (H)-axis a shift is
clearly observed in the MR-H curve when the sample is cooled in a static
magnetic field. Training effect (TE) is a significant manifestation of EB
effect which describes the decrease of EB effect when sample is successively
field-cycled at a particular temperature. We observe TE in the shift of the
MR-H curve which could be interpreted by the spin configurational relaxation
model. A strong field-cooled (FC) effect in the temperature as well as time
dependence of resistivity is observed below spin freezing temperature. The
unusual MR results measured in FC mode are interpreted in terms of
intragranular interface effect between short range ferromagnetic clusters and
spin-glass matrix giving rise to the EB effect. EB effect in MR has been
observed in bilayer or multilayer films which has not yet seen in a

liquid in SrTiO3-x single crystals. The classical limit dominates the

surface and consequently a magnetic-field induced resistivity minimum emerges.
While for the field applied in plane and normal to the current, the linear
magnetoresistance (MR) starting from small fields (< 0.5 T) appears. The large
anisotropy in the transverse MRs reveals the strong surface interlayer
scattering due to the large gradient of oxygen vacancy concentration from the
surface to the interior of SrTiO3-x single crystals. Moreover, the linear MR in
our case was likely due to the inhomogeneity of oxygen vacancies and oxygen
vacancy clusters, which could provide experimental evidences for the unusual

Graphite (HOPG). We find HOPG samples to vary significantly in their
temperature dependent resistances, even between portions taken from the same
sample, yet they exhibit consistent non-saturating magnetoresistance (MR). The
scaling behavior of the MR is shown to be characteristic of a model based on
the Hall effect in granular materials. In addition to the large, field-linear
MR, all samples exhibit Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations. Additional
samples were doped via ion-implantation by boron and phosphorous, but show no
signs of superconductivity nor any systematic change in their magnetoresistive
behavior. Analysis of the SdH data gives a 2D carrier density in agreement with

Anomalous transport in half-metallic ferromagnetic CrO2,"We have investigated transport properties of CrO2 thin films deposited on
TiO2 and sapphire substrates. The films are good metals down to low
temperatures. The residual resistivity is of the order of 6 micro-ohhmcm for
films deposited on TiO2 and two times higher for films on sapphire substrates.
The sign of the magnetoresistance (MR) changes from negative to positive at a
temperature around 100 K. This fact, as well as a rapid change in the ordinary
and anomalous Hall coefficients suggest a change in the electronic state. At
lower temperatures the MR is a linear function of the applied field. This
linear dependence might be explained as intergrain tunneling MR. This
interpretation is also suggested by the angular MR. The planar Hall effect
measurements reveal that the CrO2 thin films are not in a single magnetic
domain state even for films deposited on an isostructural TiO2 substrate.","['M. S. Anwar', 'J. Aarts']",2013-03-15T12:01:24Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3746v1

either the 331 state or the MR Pfaffian may be lower in energy depending on the
deviations. In the SLL, however, the MR Pfaffian is consistently lower in
energy except for large deviations. These results suggest that even under
moderate deviations in the interaction potential (through various physical
processes such as finite thickness, Landau level mixing, etc.), the MR Pfaffian
description is more energetically favorable than the Halperin 331 state in the

Magnetoresistance of disordered graphene: from low to high temperatures,"We present the magnetoresistance (MR) of highly doped monolayer graphene
layers grown by chemical vapor deposition on 6H-SiC. The magnetotransport
studies are performed on a large temperature range, from $T$ = 1.7 K up to room
temperature. The MR exhibits a maximum in the temperature range $120-240$ K.
The maximum is observed at intermediate magnetic fields ($B=2-6$ T), in between
the weak localization and the Shubnikov-de Haas regimes. It results from the
competition of two mechanisms. First, the low field magnetoresistance increases
continuously with $T$ and has a purely classical origin. This positive MR is
induced by thermal averaging and finds its physical origin in the energy
dependence of the mobility around the Fermi energy. Second, the high field
negative MR originates from the electron-electron interaction (EEI). The
transition from the diffusive to the ballistic regime is observed. The
amplitude of the EEI correction points towards the coexistence of both long and

Magnetic Rotational Spectroscopy (MRS) with submicron probes offers flexibility
and accuracy providing desired spatial and temporal resolution in
characterization of nanoliter droplets and thin films when other methods fall
short. MRS analyzes distinct features of the in-plane rotation of a magnetic
probe, when its magnetic moment makes full revolution following an external
rotating magnetic field. The probe demonstrates a distinguishable movement
which changes from rotation to tumbling to trembling as the frequency of
rotation of the driving magnetic field changes. In practice, MRS has been used

Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$, can be epitaxially grown onto the (0001) surface of
BaFe$_{12}$O$_{19}$(BaM), a magnetic insulator with high Curie temperature and
large perpendicular anisotropy. In the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin films grown on
non-magnetic substrates, classic weak antilocalization (WAL) is manifested as
cusp-shaped positive magnetoresistance (MR) in perpendicular magnetic fields
and parabola-shaped positive MR in parallel fields, whereas in
Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$/BaM heterostructures the low field MR is parabola-shaped,
which is positive in perpendicular fields and negative in parallel fields. The

for the first time from the precise measurements of transverse
magnetoresistance (MR) anisotropy. The area inside the A-phase (A-phase core)
corresponds to isotropic MR having no confinement to the MnSi crystal lattice.
Per contra, the MR becomes anisotropic both on the border of the A-phase and in
other magnetic phases, the strongest magnetic scattering being observed when
external magnetic field applied along [001] or [00-1] directions. We argue here
that the established MR features prove the presence of two different types of

magnetocaloric materials, an improved isothermal entropy change determination
has been put forward based on the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) equation. It was
found that the isothermal entropy change value evaluated by our method is in
excellent agreement with those determined from the Maxwell-relation (MR) for
Ni-Mn-Sn Heusler alloys, which usually presents a weak field-induced phase
transforming behavior. In comparison with MR, this method could give rise to a
favorable result derived from few thermomagnetic measurements. More
importantly, we can eliminate the isothermal entropy change overestimation
derived from MR, which always exists in the cases of Ni-Co-Mn-In and MnAs
systems with a prominent field-induced transition. These results confirmed that
such a CC-equation-based method is quite practical and superior to the MR-based
ones in eliminating the spurious spike and reducing measuring cost.","['Kun Xu', 'Zhe Li', 'Yuan-Lei Zhang', 'Chao Jing']",2015-07-22T11:22:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06133v2

modulating and re-scattering the radio frequency signals impinging on their
antennas. In this correspondence, we consider a system consisting of a legacy
modulated continuous carrier multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) link and a
multi-antenna modulated re-scatter (MRS) node, where the MRS node modulates and
re-scatters the signal generated by the legacy transmitter. The receiver seeks
to decode both the original message and the information added by the MRS. We
show that the achievable sum rate of this system exceeds that which the legacy
system could achieve alone. We further consider the impact of channel
estimation errors under the least squares channel estimation and study the
achievable rate of the legacy and MRS systems, where a linear minimum mean
square error receiver with successive interference cancellation is utilized for
joint decoding.","['Ruifeng Duan', 'Riku Jäntti', 'Hüseyin Yiğitler', 'Kalle Ruttik']",2016-07-05T14:54:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01284v2

As main contribution, we construct a degenerate Gaussian process prior that,
conditionally on $\theta$, restricts the $F$ generated by this prior to satisfy
the MRs with probability one. Our prior works even in the more involved case
where the number of MRs is larger than the dimension of $\theta$. We
demonstrate that the corresponding posterior for $\theta$ is computationally
convenient. Moreover, we show that there exists a link between our procedure,
the Generalized Empirical Likelihood with quadratic criterion and the limited
information likelihood-based procedures. We provide a frequentist validation of
our procedure by showing consistency and asymptotic normality of the posterior
distribution of $\theta$. The finite sample properties of our method are

"Signifying the Schrodinger cat in the context of testing macroscopic
  realism","Macroscopic realism (MR) specifies that where a system can be found in one of
two macroscopically distinguishable states (a cat being dead or alive), the
system is always predetermined to be in one or other of the two states (prior
to measurement). Proposals to test MR generally introduce a second premise to
further qualify the meaning of MR. This paper examines two such models, the
first where the second premise is that the macroscopically distinguishable
states are quantum states (MQS) and the second where the macroscopcially
distinguishable states are localised hidden variable states (LMHVS). We point
out that in each case in order to negate the model, it is necessary to assume
that the predetermined states give microscopic detail for predictions of
measurements. Thus, it is argued that many cat-signatures do not negate MR but
could be explained by microscopic effects such as a photon-pair nonlocality.
Finally, we consider a third model, macroscopic local realism (MLR), where the
second premise is that measurements at one location cannot cause an
instantaneous macroscopic change to the system at another. By considering
amplification of the quantum noise level via a measurement process, we discuss
how negation of MLR may be possible.",['M D Reid'],2016-12-28T13:45:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08883v1

Robust Incremental Neural Semantic Graph Parsing,"Parsing sentences to linguistically-expressive semantic representations is a

We propose a neural encoder-decoder transition-based parser which is the first
full-coverage semantic graph parser for Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS). The
model architecture uses stack-based embedding features, predicting graphs
jointly with unlexicalized predicates and their token alignments. Our parser is
more accurate than attention-based baselines on MRS, and on an additional
Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) benchmark, and GPU batch processing makes
it an order of magnitude faster than a high-precision grammar-based parser.
Further, the 86.69% Smatch score of our MRS parser is higher than the

  Material ZrSiSe","The family of materials defined as ZrSiX (X = S, Se, Te) has been established
as Dirac node-line semimetals, and subsequent study is urgent to exploit the
promising application of unusual magnetoresistance property. In this work, we
systematically investigated the anisotropic magnetoresistance in the
newly-discovered Dirac node-line material ZrSiSe. By applying a magnetic field
of 3 T by a vector field, the three-dimensional (3D) magnetoresistance (MR)
shows strong anisotropy. The MR ratio of maximum and minimum directions can
reach 7 at 3 T and keeps increasing at the higher magnetic field. The
anisotropic MR forms a butterfly-shaped curve, which indicates the quasi-2D
electronic structures. This is further confirmed by the angular-dependent
Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations. The first-principles calculations
establish the quasi-2D tubular-shaped Fermi surface near the X point in the

"Negative to Positive Magnetoresistance transition in Functionalization

carbon nanotube(CNT) and functionalized carbon nanotube(fCNT) composites have
been studied for different weight percentage down to the temperature 4.2K and
up to magnetic field 5T. Resistivity increases significantly in composite at
low temperature due to functionalization of CNT compare to only CNT.
Interestingly transition from negative to positive magnetoresistance has been
observed for 10wt% of composite as the effect of disorder is more in fCNT/PANI.
This result depicts that the MR has strong dependency on disorder in the
composite system. The transition of MR has been explained in the basis of
polaron-bipolaron model. The long range Coulomb interaction between two
polarons screened by disorder in the composite of fCNT/PANI, increases the
effective on-site Coulomb repulsion energy to form bipolaron which leads to
change the sign of MR from negative to positive.","['Krishna Prasad Maity', 'Narendra Tanty', 'Ananya Patra', 'V Prasad']",2017-11-06T15:30:37Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01957v2

The main attention has been devoted to manifestation of these effects in

2D intensity patches capture the local spatial context while large, compressed

spatial consistency. Contrary to commonly used segmentation methods, our
technique does not require any non-linear registration of the MR images. To

"DeepcomplexMRI: Exploiting deep residual network for fast parallel MR
  imaging with complex convolution","This paper proposes a multi-channel image reconstruction method, named
DeepcomplexMRI, to accelerate parallel MR imaging with residual complex
convolutional neural network. Different from most existing works which rely on
the utilization of the coil sensitivities or prior information of predefined
transforms, DeepcomplexMRI takes advantage of the availability of a large
number of existing multi-channel groudtruth images and uses them as labeled
data to train the deep residual convolutional neural network offline. In
particular, a complex convolutional network is proposed to take into account
the correlation between the real and imaginary parts of MR images. In addition,
the k space data consistency is further enforced repeatedly in between layers
of the network. The evaluations on in vivo datasets show that the proposed
method has the capability to recover the desired multi-channel images. Its

Estimation of Markovian-regime-switching models with independent regimes,"Markovian-regime-switching (MRS) models are commonly used for modelling
economic time series, including electricity prices where independent regime
models are used, since they can more accurately and succinctly capture
electricity price dynamics than dependent regime MRS models can. We can think
of these independent regime MRS models for electricity prices as a collection
of independent AR(1) processes, of which only one process is observed at each
time; which is observed is determined by a (hidden) Markov chain. Here we
develop novel, computationally feasible methods for MRS models with independent
regimes including forward, backward and EM algorithms. The key idea is to
augment the hidden process with a counter which records the time since the
hidden Markov chain last visited each state that corresponding to an AR(1)

"k-t NEXT: Dynamic MR Image Reconstruction Exploiting Spatio-temporal
  Correlations","Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exhibits high correlations in
k-space and time. In order to accelerate the dynamic MR imaging and to exploit
k-t correlations from highly undersampled data, here we propose a novel deep
learning based approach for dynamic MR image reconstruction, termed k-t NEXT
(k-t NEtwork with X-f Transform). In particular, inspired by traditional
methods such as k-t BLAST and k-t FOCUSS, we propose to reconstruct the true
signals from aliased signals in x-f domain to exploit the spatio-temporal
redundancies. Building on that, the proposed method then learns to recover the
signals by alternating the reconstruction process between the x-f space and
image space in an iterative fashion. This enables the network to effectively
capture useful information and jointly exploit spatio-temporal correlations
from both complementary domains. Experiments conducted on highly undersampled
short-axis cardiac cine MRI scans demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms the current state-of-the-art dynamic MR reconstruction approaches
both quantitatively and qualitatively.","['Chen Qin', 'Jo Schlemper', 'Jinming Duan', 'Gavin Seegoolam', 'Anthony Price', 'Joseph Hajnal', 'Daniel Rueckert']",2019-07-22T16:51:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09425v1
"Inference After Selecting Plausibly Valid Instruments with Application
  to Mendelian Randomization","Mendelian randomization (MR) is a popular method in genetic epidemiology to
estimate the effect of an exposure on an outcome by using genetic instruments.
These instruments are often selected from a combination of prior knowledge from
genome wide association studies (GWAS) and data-driven instrument selection
procedures or tests. Unfortunately, when testing for the exposure effect, the
instrument selection process done a priori is not accounted for. This paper
studies and highlights the bias resulting from not accounting for the
instrument selection process by focusing on a recent data-driven instrument
selection procedure, sisVIVE, as an example. We introduce a conditional
inference approach that conditions on the instrument selection done a priori
and leverage recent advances in selective inference to derive conditional null
distributions of popular test statistics for the exposure effect in MR. The
null distributions can be characterized with individual-level or summary-level
data in MR. We show that our conditional confidence intervals derived from
conditional null distributions attain the desired nominal level while typical
confidence intervals computed in MR do not. We conclude by reanalyzing the
effect of BMI on diastolic blood pressure using summary-level data from the
UKBiobank that accounts for instrument selection.","['Nan Bi', 'Hyunseung Kang', 'Jonathan Taylor']",2019-11-10T19:28:23Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03985v1
Detecting chirality in two-terminal electronic devices,"Central to spintronics is the interconversion between electronic charge and
spin currents, and this can arise from the chirality-induced spin selectivity
(CISS) effect. CISS is often studied as magnetoresistance (MR) in two-terminal
(2T) electronic devices containing a chiral (molecular) component and a
ferromagnet. However, fundamental understanding of when and how this MR can
occur is lacking. Here, we uncover an elementary mechanism that generates such
a MR for nonlinear response. It requires energy-dependent transport and energy
relaxation within the device. The sign of the MR depends on chirality, charge
carrier type, and bias direction. Additionally, we reveal how CISS can be
detected in the linear response regime in magnet-free 2T devices, either by
forming a chirality-based spin-valve using two or more chiral components, or by
Hanle spin precession in devices with a single chiral component. Our results
provide operation principles and design guidelines for chirality-based
spintronic devices and technologies.","['Xu Yang', 'Caspar H. van der Wal', 'Bart J. van Wees']",2019-12-19T09:41:28Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09085v3

(dHvA) effect studies of the single crystals of tungsten carbide, WC, which is
predicted to be a new type of topological semimetal with triply degenerate
nodes. With the magnetic field rotated in the plane perpendicular to the
current, WC shows field induced metal to insulator like transition and large
nonsaturating quadratic MR at low temperature. As the magnetic field parallel
to the current, a pronounced negative longitudinal MR only can be observed when
the current flows along the certain direction. Hall effect indicates WC is a
perfect compensated semimetal, which may be related to the large nonsaturating
quadratic MR. The analysis of dHvA oscillations reveals that WC is a multiband

"Spin-orbit coupling and transport of strongly correlated two-dimensional
  systems","Measuring the magnetoresistance (MR) of ultraclean {\it GaAs} two-dimensional
holes in a large $r_s$ range of 20-50, two striking behaviors in relation to
the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) emerge in response to strong electron-electron
interaction. First, in exact correspondence to the zero-field
metal-to-insulator transition (MIT), the sign of the MR switches from being
positive in the metallic regime to being negative in the insulating regime when
the carrier density crosses the critical density $p_c$ of MIT ($r_s\sim 39$).
Second, as the SOC-driven correction $\Delta\rho$ to the MR decreases with
reducing carrier density (or the in-plane wave vector), it exhibits an upturn
in the close proximity just above $p_c$ where $r_s$ is beyond 30, indicating a
substantially enhanced SOC effect. This peculiar behavior echoes with a trend
of delocalization long suspected for the SOC-interaction interplay. Meanwhile,
for $p<p_c$ or $r_s>40$, in contrast to the common belief that a magnet field
enhances Wigner crystallization, the negative MR is likely linked to enhanced
interaction.","['Jian Huang', 'L. N. Pfeiffer', 'K. W. West']",2017-06-01T13:43:59Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00297v1
"Deep Autoencoding Models for Unsupervised Anomaly Segmentation in Brain

normal cases is a very appealing approach for detecting pathologies in medical

made in the medical domain, based on statistical methods, content-based
retrieval, clustering and recently also deep learning. Previous approaches
towards deep unsupervised anomaly detection model patches of normal anatomy
with variants of Autoencoders or GANs, and detect anomalies either as outliers
in the learned feature space or from large reconstruction errors. In contrast
to these patch-based approaches, we show that deep spatial autoencoding models
can be efficiently used to capture normal anatomical variability of entire 2D
brain MR images. A variety of experiments on real MR data containing MS lesions
corroborates our hypothesis that we can detect and even delineate anomalies in
brain MR images by simply comparing input images to their reconstruction.

Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Quantification using Deep Learning,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is an important technique in biomedical
research and it has the unique capability to give a non-invasive access to the
biochemical content (metabolites) of scanned organs. In the literature, the
quantification (the extraction of the potential biomarkers from the MRS
signals) involves the resolution of an inverse problem based on a parametric
model of the metabolite signal. However, poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
presence of the macromolecule signal or high correlation between metabolite
spectral patterns can cause high uncertainties for most of the metabolites,
which is one of the main reasons that prevents use of MRS in clinical routine.
In this paper, quantification of metabolites in MR Spectroscopic imaging using
deep learning is proposed. A regression framework based on the Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN) is introduced for an accurate estimation of spectral
parameters. The proposed model learns the spectral features from a large-scale

"Giant gate-controlled proximity magnetoresistance in semiconductor-based
  ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic bilayers","The evolution of information technology has been driven by the discovery of
new forms of large magnetoresistance (MR), such as giant magnetoresistance
(GMR) and tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) in magnetic multilayers. Recently,
new types of MR have been observed in much simpler bilayers consisting of
ferromagnetic (FM)/nonmagnetic (NM) thin films; however, the magnitude of MR in
these materials is very small (0.01 ~ 1%). Here, we demonstrate that NM/FM
bilayers consisting of a NM InAs quantum well conductive channel and an
insulating FM (Ga,Fe)Sb layer exhibit giant proximity magnetoresistance (PMR)
(~80% at 14 T). This PMR is two orders of magnitude larger than the MR observed
in NM/FM bilayers reported to date, and its magnitude can be controlled by a
gate voltage. These results are explained by the penetration of the InAs
two-dimensional-electron wavefunction into (Ga,Fe)Sb. The ability to strongly
modulate the NM channel current by both electrical and magnetic gating
represents a new concept of magnetic-gating spin transistors.","['Kosuke Takiguchi', 'Le Duc Anh', 'Takahiro Chiba', 'Tomohiro Koyama', 'Daichi Chiba', 'Masaaki Tanaka']",2018-12-27T08:12:53Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10655v1

decreases and for a certain doping concentration giant negative MR is observed
which persists up to room temperature. Magnetic measurement indicates that the
negative MR is observed when ferromagnetic ordering is induced with Fe doping.
The magnetic ordering can be attributed with the RKKY interaction. Positive MR
reappears with larger doping concentration which may be attributed to the
decrease of FM ordering due to the turning off of the spin-orbit coupling
leading to the destruction of non-trivial bulk state. This in-effect
de-hybridizes the conduction band with the Fe spin. The ARPES data also
indicates that above a critical doping concentration (x>0.09) the non-trivial

The present work demonstrates that all salient features of these devices,

Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based multi-modal MR image analysis commonly

useful information from different modalities and suppress the respective noise
signals. Specifically, an attention block is introduced as guidance for the
information selection. From the different modalities, one modality that
contributes most to the results is selected as the master modality, which

address the issue. In this work, we unroll the iterations of the primal-dual

gradually relax the constraints to reconstruct MR images from highly
undersampled k-space data. The proposed method combines the theoretical
convergence guarantee of optimi-zation methods with the powerful learning
capability of deep networks. As the constraints are gradually relaxed, the
reconstruction model is finally learned from the training data by updating in

"Generating Randomness from a Computable, Non-random Sequence of Qubits","Nies and Scholz introduced the notion of a state to describe an infinite
sequence of qubits and defined quantum-Martin-Lof randomness for states,
analogously to the well known concept of Martin-L\""of randomness for elements
of Cantor space (the space of infinite sequences of bits). We formalize how
'measurement' of a state in a basis induces a probability measure on Cantor
space. A state is 'measurement random' (mR) if the measure induced by it, under
any computable basis, assigns probability one to the set of Martin-L\""of
randoms. Equivalently, a state is mR if and only if measuring it in any
computable basis yields a Martin-L\""of random with probability one. While
quantum-Martin-L\""of random states are mR, the converse fails: there is a mR
state, x which is not quantum-Martin-L\""of random. In fact, something stronger
is true. While x is computable and can be easily constructed, measuring it in
any computable basis yields an arithmetically random sequence with probability
one. I.e., classical arithmetic randomness can be generated from a computable,
non-quantum random sequence of qubits.",['Tejas Bhojraj'],2020-05-01T04:09:49Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00207v1
Prediction of Thrombectomy Functional Outcomes using Multimodal Data,"Recent randomised clinical trials have shown that patients with ischaemic
stroke {due to occlusion of a large intracranial blood vessel} benefit from
endovascular thrombectomy. However, predicting outcome of treatment in an
individual patient remains a challenge. We propose a novel deep learning
approach to directly exploit multimodal data (clinical metadata information,
imaging data, and imaging biomarkers extracted from images) to estimate the
success of endovascular treatment. We incorporate an attention mechanism in our
architecture to model global feature inter-dependencies, both channel-wise and
spatially. We perform comparative experiments using unimodal and multimodal
data, to predict functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, mRS) and

combining some winning Convolutional Neural Network models of ImageNet Large

find that detection accuracy increases drastically when we focus on the Gray
Matter (GM) and White Matter (WM) regions from the MR images instead of using
whole MR images. We achieved an average accuracy of 94.7\% using smoothed GM

"A coherent likelihood parametrization for doubly robust estimation of a
  causal effect with missing confounders","Missing data and confounding are two problems researchers face in
observational studies for comparative effectiveness. Williamson et al. (2012)
recently proposed a unified approach to handle both issues concurrently using a
multiply-robust (MR) methodology under the assumption that confounders are
missing at random. Their approach considers a union of models in which any
submodel has a parametric component while the remaining models are
unrestricted. We show that while their estimating function is MR in theory, the
possibility for multiply robust inference is complicated by the fact that
parametric models for different components of the union model are not variation
independent and therefore the MR property is unlikely to hold in practice. To
address this, we propose an alternative transparent parametrization of the
likelihood function, which makes explicit the model dependencies between
various nuisance functions needed to evaluate the MR efficient score. The
proposed method is genuinely doubly-robust (DR) in that it is consistent and
asymptotic normal if one of two sets of modeling assumptions holds. We evaluate
the performance and doubly robust property of the DR method via a simulation
study.","['Katherine Evans', 'Isabel Fulcher', 'Eric J. Tchetgen Tchetgen']",2020-07-20T18:28:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10393v1

when the magnetic field is applied perpendicularly to the CrO$_2$ plane with
the maximum MR ratio ($\approx$ 15%) at the magnetic ordering temperature.
These features are distinct from those observed in conventional magnetic

"Fine Perceptive GANs for Brain MR Image Super-Resolution in Wavelet
  Domain","Magnetic resonance imaging plays an important role in computer-aided
diagnosis and brain exploration. However, limited by hardware, scanning time
and cost, it's challenging to acquire high-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance
(MR) image clinically. In this paper, fine perceptive generative adversarial
networks (FP-GANs) is proposed to produce HR MR images from low-resolution
counterparts. It can cope with the detail insensitive problem of the existing
super-resolution model in a divide-and-conquer manner. Specifically, FP-GANs
firstly divides an MR image into low-frequency global approximation and
high-frequency anatomical texture in wavelet domain. Then each sub-band
generative adversarial network (sub-band GAN) conquers the super-resolution
procedure of each single sub-band image. Meanwhile, sub-band attention is
deployed to tune focus between global and texture information. It can focus on
sub-band images instead of feature maps to further enhance the anatomical
reconstruction ability of FP-GANs. In addition, inverse discrete wavelet
transformation (IDWT) is integrated into model for taking the reconstruction of
whole image into account. Experiments on MultiRes_7T dataset demonstrate that
FP-GANs outperforms the competing methods quantitatively and qualitatively.","['Senrong You', 'Yong Liu', 'Baiying Lei', 'Shuqiang Wang']",2020-11-09T02:09:44Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04145v1
"Multi-task MR Imaging with Iterative Teacher Forcing and Re-weighted

applications. In this paper, we develop a re-weighted multi-task deep learning
method to learn prior knowledge from the existing big dataset and then utilize
them to assist simultaneous MR reconstruction and segmentation from the
under-sampled k-space data. The multi-task deep learning framework is equipped
with two network sub-modules, which are integrated and trained by our designed
iterative teacher forcing scheme (ITFS) under the dynamic re-weighted loss
constraint (DRLC). The ITFS is designed to avoid error accumulation by
injecting the fully-sampled data into the training process. The DRLC is
proposed to dynamically balance the contributions from the reconstruction and
segmentation sub-modules so as to co-prompt the multi-task accuracy. The
proposed method has been evaluated on two open datasets and one in vivo

Enhanced diffusivity in microscopically reversible active matter,"Physics of self-propelled objects at the nanoscale is a rapidly developing
research field where recent experiments focused on motion of individual
catalytic enzymes. Contrary to the experimental advancements, theoretical
understanding of possible self-propulsion mechanisms at these scales is

diffusivities of the individual enzymes. Here we start with the fundamental
principle of microscopic reversibility (MR) of chemical reactions powering the
self-propulsion and demonstrate that MR can lead to increase of the particle
mobility and of short- and long-time diffusion coefficients as compared to
dynamics where MR is neglected. Moreover, the diffusion coefficients can be
enhanced by a constant external force. We propose a way to use these effects in
experimental investigations of active propulsion mechanisms at the nanoscale.

a many weak invalid instruments asymptotic regime by developing novel
semiparametric theory. We also provide a measure of weak identification, an
overidentification test, and a graphical diagnostic tool. We demonstrate in

"A Focusing Framework for Testing Bi-Directional Causal Effects with GWAS

pleiotropy adds another layer of complexity. In this article, we show that
assumptions for common MR methods are often impossible or too stringent in the
existence of bi-directional relationships. We then propose a new focusing

planning (mCPP) problem in large-scale planar areas with random dynamic
interferers in the environment, where the robots have limited resources. We
introduce a worker-station MRS consisting of multiple workers with limited
resources for actual work, and one station with enough resources for resource
replenishment. We aim to solve the mCPP problem for the worker-station MRS by
formulating it as a fully cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning
problem. Then we propose an end-to-end decentralized online planning method,
which simultaneously solves coverage planning for workers and rendezvous
planning for station. Our method manages to reduce the influence of random
dynamic interferers on planning, while the robots can avoid collisions with
them. We conduct simulation and real robot experiments, and the comparison
results show that our method has competitive performance in solving the mCPP
problem for worker-station MRS in metric of task finish time.","['Jingtao Tang', 'Yuan Gao', 'Tin Lun Lam']",2022-08-05T05:36:42Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02993v2
"Frequency-dependent Phonon-mediated Unidirectional Magnetoresistance in
  a Metal on an Insulator with Highly Nonequilibrium Magnons","Heavy metal (HM)/magnet bilayers host many magnetoresistances (MR) and spin
caloritronic effects. Here we show that the spin Peltier effect and
electron-phonon scattering produce much larger unidirectional MR of an HM on a
magnetic insulator than existing theories that neglect the interplay between MR
and spin caloritronic effects. By accounting for local nonequilibrium in both
the magnon chemical potential and temperature, our analytical model attributes
the observed frequency dependence of the spin Peltier MR and the spin Seebeck
effect to the reduction of the thermal penetration depth, which approaches the
1 micron scale magnon spin diffusion length at high frequencies.","['Sean E. Sullivan', 'Hwijong Lee', 'Annie Weathers', 'Li Shi']",2022-08-05T21:14:19Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03388v1
"SelfCoLearn: Self-supervised collaborative learning for accelerating
  dynamic MR imaging","Lately, deep learning has been extensively investigated for accelerating
dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, with encouraging progresses achieved.
However, without fully sampled reference data for training, current approaches
may have limited abilities in recovering fine details or structures. To address
this challenge, this paper proposes a self-supervised collaborative learning
framework (SelfCoLearn) for accurate dynamic MR image reconstruction from
undersampled k-space data. The proposed framework is equipped with three
important components, namely, dual-network collaborative learning,
reunderampling data augmentation and a specially designed co-training loss. The
framework is flexible to be integrated with both data-driven networks and
model-based iterative un-rolled networks. Our method has been evaluated on
in-vivo dataset and compared it to four state-of-the-art methods. Results show
that our method possesses strong capabilities in capturing essential and
inherent representations for direct reconstructions from the undersampled
k-space data and thus enables high-quality and fast dynamic MR imaging.","['Juan Zou', 'Cheng Li', 'Sen Jia', 'Ruoyou Wu', 'Tingrui Pei', 'Hairong Zheng', 'Shanshan Wang']",2022-08-08T04:01:26Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03904v1

"Dominance of Electron-Magnon Scattering in Itinerant Ferromagnet
  Fe3GeTe2","Fe3GeTe2 is a 2-dimensional van der Waals material exhibiting itinerant
ferromagnetism upto 230 K. Here, we study aspects of scattering mechanism in
Fe3Ge2Te2 single crystals via resistivity, magneto-transport and Hall effect
measurements. The quadratic temperature dependence of electrical resistivity
below the Curie temperature hints towards the dominance of electron-magnon
scattering. A non-saturating positive magnetoresistance (MR) is observed at low
temperatures when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the sample plane.
The linear negative MR at high fields for T < TC corroborates to the
suppression in magnon population due to the damping of spin waves. In the high
temperature regime T > TC,MR can be described by the scattering from spin
fluctuations using the model described by Khosla and Fischer. Isothermal Hall
resistivity curves unveil the presence of anomalous Hall resistivity.
Correlation between MR and side jump mechanism further reveals that the
electron-magnon scattering is responsible for the side jump contribution to the
anomalous Hall effect. Our results provide a clear understanding of the role of
electron-magnon scattering on anomalous Hall effect that rules out its origin
to be the topological band structure.","['P. Saha', 'M. Singh', 'V. Nagpal', 'P. Das', 'S. Patnaik']",2022-09-08T04:16:14Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03555v1

"Generalized Deep Learning-based Proximal Gradient Descent for MR
  Reconstruction","The data consistency for the physical forward model is crucial in inverse
problems, especially in MR imaging reconstruction. The standard way is to
unroll an iterative algorithm into a neural network with a forward model
embedded. The forward model always changes in clinical practice, so the
learning component's entanglement with the forward model makes the
reconstruction hard to generalize. The deep learning-based proximal gradient
descent was proposed and use a network as regularization term that is
independent of the forward model, which makes it more generalizable for
different MR acquisition settings. This one-time pre-trained regularization is
applied to different MR acquisition settings and was compared to conventional
L1 regularization showing ~3 dB improvement in the peak signal-to-noise ratio.
We also demonstrated the flexibility of the proposed method in choosing
different undersampling patterns.","['Guanxiong Luo', 'Mengmeng Kuang', 'Peng Cao']",2022-11-30T10:31:06Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16881v2
"Quantum-limit phenomena and bandstructure in the magnetic topological
  semimetal EuZn2As2","We have experimentally investigated the low-temperature (0.6 K) electronic
and magnetic properties of the layered antiferromagnet EuZn2As2 in pulsed
magnetic fields of up to 60 T at a temperature of 0.6 K, giant positive
magnetoresistance (MR) is observed above \mu_{0}H ~ 20 T, a regime in which the
spins are already fully polarized. Both magnetic torque and proximity detector
oscillator (PDO) data show no corresponding anomaly at or close to this field.
By analyzing the quantum oscillations observed in the MR and PDO frequency, we
find that (1) the oscillation frequency F = 46 \pm 6 T for H // c and 42 \pm 2
T for H // ab; (2) the corresponding Berry phase is close to \pi for H // c,
implying a nontrivial topology; and (3) the large linear MR at high fields
corresponds to the quantum limit (i.e., only the last Landau level being
occupied). From these observations we conclude that the linear MR can be
understood by considering diffusing cyclotron centers in the quantum limit. Our
findings help understand the intimate relationship between magnetism and
electronic topology in EuZn2As2 under extremely high fields and suggest reasons
for the emergent behavior in the quantum limit.","['Joanna Blawat', 'Smita Speer', 'John Singleton', 'Weiwei Xie', 'Rongying Jin']",2023-04-24T20:12:29Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12426v1
"A Trivial Geometrical Phase of an Electron Wavefunction in a Direct Band
  Gap Semiconductor CdGeAs$_{2}$","Chalcopyrite compounds are extensively explored for their exotic topological

the electrical transport properties of a direct energy gap semiconductor

around 136% at a temperature of 1.8 K and a magnetic field of 14 T, following
the semiclassical exponent MR $\sim$ $B^{2.18}$. The MR analysis exhibits a
violation of the Kohler rule, suggesting the involvement of multiple carriers
in the system. Below 15 K, with decreasing magnetic field, the MR increases,
leading to the well known quantum interference phenomenon weak localization
(WL). The analysis of the magnetoconductivity data based on the
Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka (HLN) model unveils three dimensional nature of the WL
and the weak spin-orbit coupling in CdGeAs$_{2}$. The phase coherence length

Self-Supervised Federated Learning for Fast MR Imaging,"Federated learning (FL) based magnetic resonance (MR) image reconstruction
can facilitate learning valuable priors from multi-site institutions without
violating patient's privacy for accelerating MR imaging. However, existing
methods rely on fully sampled data for collaborative training of the model. The
client that only possesses undersampled data can neither participate in FL nor
benefit from other clients. Furthermore, heterogeneous data distributions
hinder FL from training an effective deep learning reconstruction model and
thus cause performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose a
Self-Supervised Federated Learning method (SSFedMRI). SSFedMRI explores the
physics-based contrastive reconstruction networks in each client to realize
cross-site collaborative training in the absence of fully sampled data.
Furthermore, a personalized soft update scheme is designed to simultaneously
capture the global shared representations among different centers and maintain
the specific data distribution of each client. The proposed method is evaluated
on four datasets and compared to the latest state-of-the-art approaches.
Experimental results demonstrate that SSFedMRI possesses strong capability in
reconstructing accurate MR images both visually and quantitatively on both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets.","['Juan Zou', 'Cheng Li', 'Ruoyou Wu', 'Tingrui Pei', 'Hairong Zheng', 'Shanshan Wang']",2023-05-10T11:34:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06066v1
"Coherent two-dimensional THz magnetic resonance spectroscopies for
  molecular magnets: Analysis of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction","To investigate the novel quantum dynamic behaviors of magnetic materials that
arise from complex spin-spin interactions, it is necessary to probe the
magnetic response at a speed greater than the spin-relaxation and dephasing
processes. Recently developed two-dimensional (2D) terahertz magnetic resonance
(THz-MR) spectroscopy techniques use the magnetic components of laser pulses,
and this allows investigation of the details of the ultrafast dynamics of spin
systems. For such investigations, quantum treatment -- not only of the spin
system itself but also of the environment surrounding the spin system -- is
important. In our method, based on the theory of multidimensional optical
spectroscopy, we formulate nonlinear THz-MR spectra using an approach based on
the numerically rigorous hierarchical equations of motion. We conduct numerical
calculations of both linear (1D) and 2D THz-MR spectra for a linear chiral spin
chain. The pitch and direction of chirality (clockwise or anticlockwise) are
determined by the strength and sign of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
(DMI). We show that not only the strength but also the sign of the DMI can be
evaluated through the use of 2D THz-MR spectroscopic measurements, while 1D
measurements allow us to determine only the strength.","['Jiaji Zhang', 'Yoshitaka Tanimura']",2023-06-17T01:15:46Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10222v1
Deep unrolling Shrinkage Network for Dynamic MR imaging,"Deep unrolling networks that utilize sparsity priors have achieved great
success in dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The convolutional neural
network (CNN) is usually utilized to extract the transformed domain, and then
the soft thresholding (ST) operator is applied to the CNN-transformed data to
enforce the sparsity priors. However, the ST operator is usually constrained to
be the same across all channels of the CNN-transformed data. In this paper, we
propose a novel operator, called soft thresholding with channel attention
(AST), that learns the threshold for each channel. In particular, we put
forward a novel deep unrolling shrinkage network (DUS-Net) by unrolling the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for optimizing the
transformed $l_1$ norm dynamic MR reconstruction model. Experimental results on
an open-access dynamic cine MR dataset demonstrate that the proposed DUS-Net

"Multiply Robust Estimator Circumvents Hyperparameter Tuning of Neural
  Network Models in Causal Inference","Estimation of the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is often carried out in 2
steps, wherein the first step, the treatment and outcome are modeled, and in
the second step the predictions are inserted into the ATE estimator. In the
first steps, numerous models can be fit to the treatment and outcome, including
using machine learning algorithms. However, it is a difficult task to choose
among the hyperparameter sets which will result in the best causal effect
estimation and inference. Multiply Robust (MR) estimator allows us to leverage
all the first-step models in a single estimator. We show that MR estimator is
$n^r$ consistent if one of the first-step treatment or outcome models is $n^r$
consistent. We also show that MR is the solution to a broad class of estimating
equations, and is asymptotically normal if one of the treatment models is
$\sqrt{n}$-consistent. The standard error of MR is also calculated which does
not require a knowledge of the true models in the first step. Our simulations

"Magnetic Resonance Parameter Mapping using Self-supervised Deep Learning

quantitative MRI (qMRI) reconstruction. The proposed method uses an
optimization algorithm to unroll a model-based qMRI reconstruction into a deep
learning framework, enabling the generation of highly accurate and robust MR
parameter maps at imaging acceleration. Unlike conventional deep learning
methods requiring a large amount of training data, RELAX-MORE is a
subject-specific method that can be trained on single-subject data through
self-supervised learning, making it accessible and practically applicable to
many qMRI studies. Using the quantitative $T_1$ mapping as an example at
different brain, knee and phantom experiments, the proposed method demonstrates
excellent performance in reconstructing MR parameters, correcting imaging
artifacts, removing noises, and recovering image features at imperfect imaging
conditions. Compared with other state-of-the-art conventional and deep learning
methods, RELAX-MORE significantly improves efficiency, accuracy, robustness,

"Woolf et als GWAS by subtraction is not useful for cross-generational

Winner's Curse Free Robust Mendelian Randomization with Summary Data,"In the past decade, the increased availability of genome-wide association
studies summary data has popularized Mendelian Randomization (MR) for
conducting causal inference. MR analyses, incorporating genetic variants as
instrumental variables, are known for their robustness against reverse
causation bias and unmeasured confounders. Nevertheless, classical MR analyses
utilizing summary data may still produce biased causal effect estimates due to
the winner's curse and pleiotropic issues. To address these two issues and
establish valid causal conclusions, we propose a unified robust Mendelian
Randomization framework with summary data, which systematically removes the
winner's curse and screens out invalid genetic instruments with pleiotropic
effects. Different from existing robust MR literature, our framework delivers
valid statistical inference on the causal effect neither requiring the genetic
pleiotropy effects to follow any parametric distribution nor relying on perfect
instrument screening property. Under appropriate conditions, we show that our
proposed estimator converges to a normal distribution and its variance can be
well estimated. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed estimator
through Monte Carlo simulations and two case studies. The codes implementing
the procedures are available at https://github.com/ChongWuLab/CARE/.","['Zhongming Xie', 'Wanheng Zhang', 'Jingshen Wang', 'Chong Wu']",2023-09-10T08:11:58Z,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04957v1
"Bridging the Gap: A Unified Video Comprehension Framework for Moment
  Retrieval and Highlight Detection","Video Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD) have attracted
significant attention due to the growing demand for video analysis. Recent
approaches treat MR and HD as similar video grounding problems and address them
together with transformer-based architecture. However, we observe that the
emphasis of MR and HD differs, with one necessitating the perception of local
relationships and the other prioritizing the understanding of global contexts.
Consequently, the lack of task-specific design will inevitably lead to
limitations in associating the intrinsic specialty of two tasks. To tackle the
issue, we propose a Unified Video COMprehension framework (UVCOM) to bridge the
gap and jointly solve MR and HD effectively. By performing progressive
integration on intra and inter-modality across multi-granularity, UVCOM
achieves the comprehensive understanding in processing a video. Moreover, we
present multi-aspect contrastive learning to consolidate the local relation
modeling and global knowledge accumulation via well aligned multi-modal space.

In this work, CrxSe single crystals with high Cr content (x=0.87, 0.91 and
